            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This reſolation ſeemed very good to <hi>Poleron;</hi> and for to put it in preſent execution, I will, ſaid hee, goe fetch you the better of two ſutes, which I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weare upon our Village feaſt dayes; and when you are accommodated, I will ſay that you are one of my kinſmen, which for my ſake hath left his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to paſſe his life here with me; ſo you ſhall be in all libertie, and ſuſpected of no man.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman had ſcarcely loſt the ſight of <hi>Poleron,</hi> when he perceived come out of the ſame place, from whence he was come before, three men well mounted, whereof one had his viſage maſqued and led by a Peaſant; as ſoone as they did perceive the gentleman, fury did ſo ſtrongly tranſport them, that all three drawing their ſwords fell upon him to maſſacre him. He did what he could to defend himſelfe, and ſhewed all the courage that could bee imagined, but all in vaine, for the party was not equall.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54530:7"/>man had together, was heard by <hi>Jacinte,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lizeron</hi> her Brother, which were hidden amongſt the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt buſhes, who ſeeing the ſtranger all alone, and abandoned to the mercy of his Enemies, ran to ayd him, or at leaſt to ſtay by their preſence the evident danger that threatned him; for although they did not know him, yet they did ſo affect him, having heard him ſay that he would ſtay with them, and quit the glory of his condition for to accommodate himſelf after the ſimplicity of theirs: but they could not make ſo great haſt to come to him, as the others did to take away his life, ſo that at the inſtant that they approached, the ſtranger fell to the ground, hurt with two great wounds, and had received many others without their Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall. The murderers fearing that <hi>Lizeron</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinte</hi> were followed with many other Shepherds, withdrew themſelves into the ſame place from whence they were come; fearing that if they ſhould ſtay, the advantage which they had gotten, might be changed into diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>They ſurprized <hi>Clitor</hi> the Shepherd which guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, in demanding of him at their meeting, if he had ſeen paſſe that way a Cavalier of the ſame feature and in the ſame habits of him that was hurt, and he having anſwered them, yea, they prayed him to conduct them the ſame way he had taken, making him believe that this was their Maſter, ahd that they had loſt him in the next wood.</p>
               <p>This Shepherd after having innocently anſwered to their demands, and ſeeing that they had almoſt killed him, ran haſtily to informe the Juſtices of their acts, who ſent preſently op and downe the

He did contemplate and admire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as much as the paſſion he ſuffered in his ſoule, and the paine of his body would permit, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and features of <hi>Jacinte:</hi> If the cauſe of the misfortune which was befalne him had been leſſe adorable, he had ſuffered himſelfe to have beene overcome by the charming lookes, and ſweet ſpeeches of <hi>Jacinte.</hi> In effect ſhe had in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo many charmes and graces, that <hi>Poleron</hi> might have been jealous, if the love which he bore her, had not rather been for divertiſement then deſigne, or that his prudence had not knowne that thoſe courteſies which ſhe rendred to this ſtranger, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from charity, and not affection.</p>

                  <p>My ordinary walkes about her houſe ſerved for diſcours to the neighbours and ſuſpition to her bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren. The eldeſt, called <hi>Don Oliban,</hi> having cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of my paſſion, made from thence the foundation of a treaſon altogether unworthy of a noble courage or an indifferent wit. Excited either by the love of his honour, or the inveterate hatred that was betwixt our fathers, he ſought by my death to put an end to their enmitie, and to give a beginning to my miſfortunes, one night being gone to the gate of his lodging, with intention to ſpeake to one of the ſervants of <hi>Laure</hi> my confidents, <hi>Oliban</hi> urged by a furious motion of choller, would take away my life, and for to render his enterpriſe leſſe doubtfull, he ſhot me into the body with a piſtoll, and caſt me upon the threſhold of the dore; many people came running at this noiſe; <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> fled, and they carryed me to my lodging, where I was carefully looked unto, and with hopes to bee cured; becauſe the wound was not deepe, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſhott being broken by a ſtrong Buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coate that I then wore.</p>

In effect it ſeemed to mee that no body ought to neglect the underſtanding of any thing, though it ſeeme but of ſmall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for it often arriveth that one may make uſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>This man, ſeeing the outrage which was done me, reſolved with himſelfe to intrap my enemy, and in caſe he could not, my father gave him leave to ſet the houſe a fire, to the end to take a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter revenge, I meane in deſtroying the family: this deſigne coming to my knowledge, I ſtayed the effect, as much for the conſideration of <hi>Laure,</hi> as for to ſatisfy my ſelfe, againſt him alone that did me the injury. During theſe inquietudes I received, a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſo excellent for the curing of my wounds, that it ſeemed I had not bled enough to pay the value thereof.

I had the honour during ſome few nights to ſpeake with <hi>Laure;</hi> but on the other ſide I did what I could to meet her brother, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred I bore him parallell'd the love I bore her. I was told he was retired into <hi>Saint Peters,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I writ to him that he wronged himſelf to make uſe of a ſanctuary againſt juſtice, and ſince that he ſearched to aſſure himſelfe he had no better refuge then his valour, whereof I would make proofe, and for that effect I deſired to ſee him in the field, the night following, to defend himſelfe from the name of Traytor which I had given him every where as he deſerved.</p>

                     <hi>Laure</hi> knew my deſigne, for poſſeſſing my heart as ſhee did, it was eaſie for her to know my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and he that I had choſen to carry my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge had told her thereof to the prejudice of mine honour and ſecreſie: ſhe prayed him not to deliver it, untill ſhe had provided a remedy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing time ſhe ſent all over to ſeeke me, to the end to diſſwade me, knowing well that I would obey all her commands. But I who feared the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhe had over my affections, and deſired to revenge my ſelfe by the favour of the obſcuritie of the night, to ſave my ſelfe the more eaſily from the hands of Iuſtice: I ſhunned thoſe to whom ſhe had given this commiſſion, the which cauſed her to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a ſtrange enterpriſe, as little juditious as promptly executed.</p>
                  <p>She determined to put her ſelfe into mans appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and to meete me where I aſſigned her brother. Alas <hi>Poleron,</hi> I then attended a perſon animated with choler and not with love; I pretended a vengance, but upon another ſubject, I hoped a ſatisfaction, but not ſo unhappy.

Alas <hi>Feniſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, thou revengeſt thy ſelfe ſeverely, ſince thou takeſt away the life of a perſon that loves thee more then her ſelfe, for to triumph more gloriouſly over thy enemies; theſe words pierced me more then a thouſand ſtabbs could have done me, deſpaire did ſo violently poſſeſſe me, that I preſented two or three times my ſwords point to my breaſt, but I know not whether a chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, or deſire to ſearch remedy for her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me, I fell downe upon my knees before her, mine eyes full of teares embracing her and ſtriving to animate her vigour. O my Queene, what ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath brought you hither? what fury hath gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my hand to commit this criminall action? ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, I ſtrived to ſtay her blood, deere <hi>Feniſe;</hi> ſaid ſhe, I thinke my ſelfe happier thus to dye, then by the hands of my enemies, my brothers, this will be a juſt repairing of the injury they have done thee for my ſake; but without loſing time, let us ſee if there be any meanes to get from hence, to ſearch ſome remedy for our evills, I am ſatisfied with thy apprehenſions; harke thee, I will tell thee what is to bee done; ſhe would have continued; but a ſwoond ſtayed her ſpeech. Imagine <hi>Poleron</hi> in what eſtate I then found my ſelfe; repreſent unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54530:12"/>your ſelfe, a rich Merchant in a tempeſt upon the Sea beaten with contrary windes, one while ready to caſt all his riches into the water to ſave his own life, then ſtaying himſelfe to lament the ineſtimable loſſe he was about to make; hoping a calme in the midſt of the tempeſt, ſo was I agitated in the ſtorme of a thouſand divers thoughts. If I ſhould leave her, thinking ſhe was dead, I was hindred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from for feare to loſe her, if ſhe was not: If I ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her, I muſt dye with a thouſand ſorrowes, and endanger my ſelfe to bee taken by Juſtice. I knew not what to doe, nor what to thinke, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I thought I felt her dye and reſpire, but, alaſs, this was a pure imagination cauſed by the force of my deſires: In fine, I ranne to the next houſe, where by the help of ſome money which I gave, I tooke wine, and a man along with mee, to helpe mee to aſſiſt her; I put a drop of that liquor in her mouth, which awakened her heart, and ſighing demanded where ſhe was. Courage my friend, ſaid I, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſpeak to her as a woman, in the preſence of this peaſant, you ſhall bee preſently at your owne houſe; ſaying ſo, this man and I tooke her up, and carryed her to the houſe of a Cavalier, my intimate friend, called <hi>Don Jovan de Valazquez:</hi> This was not without much paine and apprehenſion of being met by the Juſtices, who made their walk at that houre.</p>
                  <p>This Cavalier had a Siſter, who in charitie took an extreame care of <hi>Laure,</hi> whilſt I went to ſeek Chirurgeon, to whom I payed as much for his crecy as cure, as I had done to him that helped
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54530:13"/>me to carry her. The Chirurgeon having taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a handkerchief, which I had put in her wound to ſtay the bloud, did carefully dreſſe it, but he could not yet give us any hope of her recovery.</p>
                  <p>Behold <hi>Poleron,</hi> how rudely Fortune uſed mee; ſhe was not onely content to deprive me of all ſorts of goods, but alſo of all my hopes thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the interim, the abſence of <hi>Laure</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, all her Fathers houſe was in an uproare; but the brute paſſed not the doores, as well becauſe the honour of a family is in danger of Shipwrack, when it is toſſed by the windes of popular mouthes; as alſo to make way the better to the revenge her Brothers hoped to take, thinking by this ſilence to take away all apprehenſion to their enemy.</p>
                  <p>They incontinently perſwaded themſelves, that there was none in the towne capable of the Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Laure</hi> but my ſelfe; for they knew well that I ſerved her, and that ſhe had ſome inclination to mee; ſo that they were reſolved to pull out my heart, and ſeek me even to the center of the Earth, if I ſhould be there.</p>
                  <p>This project was not ſo ſecretly kept but it came to the knowledge of one of their ſervants whom I had obliged with divers preſents, who came to give me advice thereof: At her firſt ſeeing me, ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded where <hi>Laure</hi> was, and I being afraid of a double intelligence (from thoſe that are for them will give moſt) counterfeited to be aſtoniſhed, faigning to know nothing of her abſence; ſhee who was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet enough, preſſed me no further: Well, well, ſayd ſhe, in what place ſoever ſhe is, doe not often
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54530:13"/>frequent her, for her brothers have eſpies to trappe you both together, and take away your lives at the ſame time. If you bee wiſe get away from this place, otherwiſe you are in danger to be ſlaine; doe not neglect my counſell. I deſiring to conſerve my ſelfe, more for the conſideration of <hi>Laure</hi> than mine own, went to <hi>Cigarales,</hi> which are the chiefeſt Farmes belonging to the Citizens of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the houſe of a Farmer, who before had ſerved in my fathers houſe. I much deſired to hear newes from <hi>Laure,</hi> and to let her hear from me, but I durſt not confide in any one. And although I had no great cauſe to be in paine for her, having left her in ſuch hands, yet I could not continue long time where I was, being ignorant in what eſtate ſhe was. A heart that wants that which it deſireth, is in perpetuall inquietude: I knew not whether I was dead or alive, ſo that to know certainely the eſtate of my life, it was neceſſary that I ſhould ſearch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54530:14"/>men had a deſigne upon me, therefore I went into the next thicke wood to hide my felfe from them, being behind a very thicke tuft, I ſaw them paſſe by me, very much troubled having loſt the ſight of me, they looked here and there doubting what to doe. And becauſe I was not in too ſecure a place, I went amongſt the rockes, knowing it rather deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then valour to attend their comming; where perceiving my ſelfe amongſt ſo many precipices and not knowing which way to avoid them, I lighted &amp; and left my horſe at hazard, I had wandred amongſt the rockes almoſt two houres ſearching the refuge of ſome ſhephards cabin; when I ſo happily found you neere the fountaine where I was catched by mine enemies, whileſt you went to fetch me habits to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe my ſelfe.</p>

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54530:14"/>was aſtoniſhed at his arrivall, he was now altogether confuſed; but uſing prudence, he endeavoured to moderate the too violent motion of this ruſtique magiſtrate, he told him he did not aske for the houſe whither he would have him, but the reaſon of his impriſonment, the which inſtead of appeaſing him provoked him the more, in ſuch manner that he went to have layd hold of this infortunate Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, if the Pregnotory had not told him that he ought not to proceede with ſo much incivility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a gentleman; the Judge being thereupon freſhly angred, fell to cuffs with the Pregnoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry untill the blood came from both their noſes.</p>
                  <p>This little tragy-comedy did not at all pleaſe <hi>Feniſe</hi> for having beene acted upon his occaſion, he feared to pay the charges thereof by ſome rude uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. <hi>Poleron</hi> being of the ſame opinion, counſelled <hi>Feniſe</hi> to ſuffer this brute to doe what he would, aſſuring him to take him preſently out of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he confiding in this ſuffered himſelfe to be taken priſoner.</p>
                  <p>They put him in the ſame priſon where the young man was, that the judge had taken the ſame day that <hi>Feniſe</hi> was hurt, and who had ſuffered him to lye there without queſtioning him, expecting a fitt occaſion to ſend him to <hi>Toledo,</hi> knowing himſelfe not capable enough to forme a proceſſe of ſo high a nature. By the light of a lampe they chained <hi>Feniſe</hi> as a criminall of ſtate, to the other end of the beame whereunto the firſt was tyed, who was very glad to have a companion to entertaine himſelfe with. Whilſt they were tying <hi>Feniſe</hi> the other attentively regarded him, thinking that hee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54530:15"/>knew him, and when they were alone without light, he diſguiſing his voice demanded of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier the cauſe of his impriſonment, my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is the onely cauſe, anſwered <hi>Feniſe;</hi> for I doe not believe that I have deſerved this puniſhment, by the tone of his voice the firſt priſoner confirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the opinion that he had that he knew <hi>Feniſe;</hi> yet he was ſo amazed with this ſtrange incounter, that being night he thought he dreamed: when an infortunate perſon receives any contentment hee thinkes it an illuſion. <hi>Feniſe</hi> had alſo the curioſitie to enquire the misfortunes of his companion, who anſwered him alwayes in a diſguiſed voice. You and I are of different opinions, you ſay your ill fortune hath brought you hither, &amp; I that my good fortune hath conducted me, and rendred my captivitie a thouſand times more deare to me then libertie. I never heard any but you, ſaid <hi>Feniſe,</hi> ſay, that paines were pleaſant, libertie troubleſome, &amp; impriſonment delightfull; yet I eſteeme my ſelfe happy, anſwered the unknowne, in regard I finde two ſorts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, the one reall, and the other in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and although the latter be not, he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes it ſo, doth not deſire it leſſe then the firſt: ſo that I finde my priſon lovely, my chaines favours, and my paines delightfull: I am of the nature of thoſe that love their captivitie. The pearle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſerves and nouriſheth it ſelfe in a priſon of a ſhel, the diamond formes it ſelfe in congealed dew, the gold ingenders and augments by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames in the Entrailes of the Earth, and the ſoule which is the moſt perfect of all creatures next unto the angels, doth ſo well pleaſe it ſelfe in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54530:15"/>of humane bodies, that ſhe cannot quit them without great trouble, the ſame cauſe have I to love my condition. Love makes me finde delight in torments, felicitie in misfortunes, and pleaſure amongſt theſe paynes. He, anſwered <hi>Feniſe,</hi> hath no great experience of the effects of love, that taketh his afflictions for contentments. Alas love, the world would be at quiet, if it could avoid thy reaches, and warrant it ſelfe from thy deceipts.</p>
                  <p>For my part I, have a thouſand times proved, that all the evils that our miſerie hath caſt upon us in nature, are found in him; and without going about to tell them in particular, I demand what tumult is there in the World, which he cauſeth not? What ſedition, which he ſtirreth not up? Noyſe, which he makes not? What feare, which proceeds not from him? He is the moſt cruell E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of men: He betrayeth them under flattering appearances: He makes them ſwallow poyſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly prepared: in embracing them, he kills them: In brief, he is of ſuch a nature, that there are none but thoſe that know him not, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem him; therefore I wiſh that he may poſſeſſe the ſoule of him that is cauſe of my misfortunes; it is the moſt rigorous vengeance that I can deſire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſaid this with ſo much vehemency, that he thereby teſtified the paſſion which moved him, and the force of his apprehenſions; whereupon his companion anſwered; without doubt, you loue in ſuch a place where your affections are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded, ſince that you ſpeak ſo ill of him who hath been the cauſe of all the good that the Earth now poſſeſſeth, that the World admireth,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54530:16"/>and that Nature adoreth. Love is the originall of our life: He provides us nouriſhment; without him the Earth would not bring forth thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury fruits which ſerve us for food, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him men would have no communication to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: He peopleth Cities: He governeth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths: He is the Spring of Peace and Joy: His effects are Force, greatneſſe of Courage, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and Courteſie: He is the Father of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Generoſity: And I could give you exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all that I have told you in my proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if I did not feare more to weary you by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eare unto them, then to tire my ſelfe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them. In concluſion, I maintain that there is nothing without love; yea, that he is among con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Elements.</p>
                  <p>I doe not deny, anſwered <hi>Feniſe,</hi> that Love hath all theſe properties, but as no man is bound to ſay more then he knoweth of him, I that have found in his Garden nothing but thornes and bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; I tell you what I have ſeen, what I have experimented, and what I have learned of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. I doe avouch that of all humane content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is none like the pleaſures of a Lover, who is beloved with a reciprocall Affection; but this happineſſe endureth ſo little, that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Lover can ſcarcely vaunt himſelfe to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the beginning of his pleaſure, but at the ſame inſtant he loſeth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> and the unknowne Priſoner paſſed the reſt of the night in this pleaſant conteſtation, the the one conſidering the miſerable eſtate whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fortune had reduced him, not being able to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54530:16"/>have newes from <hi>Laure;</hi> the other ſatisfied with the favours of his deſtiny, deſiring alwayes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the affliction of his companions; but ſeeing that opportunity was not yet offered, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to have patience, and not to make himſelfe known, but to very good purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as it was day, <hi>Poleron</hi> went to viſit his Friend, to confirme him in the aſſurance which he had given him to deliver him from the hands of that inſolent and ignorant Judge. <hi>Feniſe</hi> thanked him for the care that he had of him, and told him that he was happy in his misfortunes, to be a priſoner with a man of ſo excellent a wit, whoſe pleaſant converſation had much diminiſhed his ſorrowes. <hi>Poleron</hi> turned himſelfe for to behold him, but the Priſoner having ſeen him enter, had turned his back againſt the light, and lay halfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon the beam, feigning to be aſleep, as well not to be in view, as for to hearken if amongſt their diſcourſes he might finde any thing that might concerne him. The two Friends believing that ſleep had ſeized him, begun to diſcourſe together, and amongſt the diſcourſes which they held, <hi>Feniſe</hi> did obſerve ſo many judicious reaſons in <hi>Poleron,</hi> that he found them to exceed the wit of a Shepherd, as already he had ſeen other teſtimonies thereof. Deſiring then to content his curioſity, he made him this diſcourſe.

                  <head>THE HISTORIE OF <hi>DON LOUIS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>NEere to the River of <hi>Tage,</hi> Nature gave me for Father and Mother two high Rocks, I may well call them ſo, ſince the two perſons that brought me into the World, having denied me paternall kindneſſes, theſe Rocks received me amiably into their laps, where, as by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, heaven was willing to ſave my life, although I might almoſt wiſh not to have been obliged to it for ſo many favours, knowing well that I might have been exempt from many pains which I have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; it was not only content to do me this grace, but it yet permitted, that <hi>Timante,</hi> a ſhepherd of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54530:17"/>this towne ſhould wander into a grove to finde me, and ſhould loſe himſelfe to get me in him a new father, and he in me an adoptive and obedient ſon. Hee tooke me from the unpitifull hardneſſe of theſe rockes where I was abandoned, carryed me away in his armes, and gave me to a peaſant who gave me the firſt nouriſhment of infancy. By little and little I grew up amongſt the other children of the towne, making appeare daily the markes of a noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, for although this ruſtique education hath rendered my behaviour rude and groſſe, yet it hath not taken from me the feeling of honour and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie.</p>
                  <p>In the flower of my youth, fearefull death came to knock at the doore of <hi>Timante;</hi> and he, receiving his advertiſments with humilitie, prepared the jewell of his ſoule, for a more pretious inchaſement; he gave me by his will the beſt part of his goods, and having taken thoſe ſpirituall refections, which the Church giveth to thoſe <hi>Pilgrims</hi> who finiſh the paſſage of the tempeſtuous Sea of this world, and come to the ſtraites of Death, he rendred his laſt ſigh. But before he came to that extremity, he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me privately to him, and told me that which I have told you, of my birth, and gave me at the ſame time a little purſe, wherein were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine papers which he ſaid he had found with me, and told me my name was <hi>Don Louis,</hi> and that I was of another linage, then I thought my ſelfe to be.</p>
                  <p>This narration did ſo elevate my courage, that I reſolved to ſearch ſome other occupation then thoſe of a village, ſo that within a ſhort time after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54530:18"/>of <hi>Timante,</hi> I ſold his goods, ſome flocks of ſheepe, and ſome lands of inheritance which he had left me, and left my village life, and country, to travell into forraine nations.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeene many townes in <hi>Spaine,</hi> clothed like a cavalier of the court, I arrived at <hi>Barcelon,</hi> with deſigne to paſſe into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to exerciſe my ſelfe in warlike affairs; but this propoſition was vaine, for a beauty which I ſaw in the towne of <hi>Barcelone</hi> hindred all my projects, and made it impoſſible for me to paſſe further. If I determined to ſee faire <hi>Italy,</hi> and begun to thinke of this maid, I found her ſo faire that I beleeved there was nothing beyond her; here was my <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> pillers: on the other ſide, if my courage reani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the deſire I had to ſeeke <hi>Laurells</hi> in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of the warres of <hi>Flanders,</hi> I found neere her ſo many Mirtles, Palmes, and glorious victories to be obtained, in remaining overcome by her charmes, that I might have beene thought to have wanted judgment, if I had neglected thoſe delitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as this adorable object appeared before mine eyes, reſpect ſeiſed me, which in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is one of the graces that renders a lover moſt commendable, but not to give occaſion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to talke, I thought it beſt to uſe the diligence of a ſervant, to goe after this beauty and follow her coach unto the place where ſhe dwelt, to the end I might endeavour to get acceſſe there: but either the impertinence of my ſervant or my proper misfortune made him loſe the fight of it, and preſently tooke from me all poſſibilitie of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54530:18"/>her my ſervice. Rare loves had never happy beginnings, it was alſo neceſſary, that mine which had a ſtrange iſſue as you ſhall ſee, ſhould have a difficult entry. The negligence of an houre coſt me almoſt three monthes (for love alwayes delights to give heavy puniſhments for light faults) ſo during this long ſpace it was impoſſible for me to have knowledge of the cauſe of my inquietudes. This made me reſolve to take againe my firſt intentions, and ſeeke my fortune in divers Countries, ſince that ſhe is not alwayes to be found in the place of a mans birth. The night before my departure I went to ſuppe with a gentleman one of my friends, for to take leave of him, from whom I departed very late: in paſſing by one of the beſt ſtreetes, I found my ſelfe neere unto five or ſix men, who without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word ſet upon two who came innocently the ſame way with me: they ſeeing themſelves ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, put themſelves into a poſture of defence, and I conſidering the inequalitie of the combatants, ranged my ſelfe with my ſword in my hand on the weaker ſide: but after a few blowes of one ſide and the other, one of the defendants was hurt and fell to the ground; at the ſame time thoſe that had wounded him, retired themſelves, &amp; the companion of him that was hurt purſued them; I ſtayed there to aſſiſt the wounded, and ſpeaking to him I knew him to be an old gentleman of qualitie, I helped him up and conducted him to his lodging; by the way he gave me a thouſand thankes for my aſſiſtance, and at every ſtep asked me what was become of <hi>Filendre:</hi> which made me beleeve that that was the name of him who was run after the enemyes. I not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54530:19"/>what to anſwer him, told him to comfort him, that he was gone to fetch a Chirurgion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we arrived at his houſe, thoſe of his family knowing that he was hurt, were all frighted; and amongſt others, a young Lady, whom the griefe of this accident had put into great confuſion. I regarded curiouſly her geſtures and actions, and knew her by the light of a torch to be the very ſame that had cauſed my torments; then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfull feare ſeized my heart, and I felt certain pricking griefes in my breaſt, as if the wound which ſhe had firſt given me with her eyes was opened again. O Beauty, that thou art ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull! ſo to aſtoniſh thoſe hearts which the moſt perilous hazards cannot affright. All the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtiques lamented the diſaſter that had befalne their Maſter, whilſt I was raviſhed in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the features of this Lady, when there came in a young man who had his countenance full of alteration, and his ſpirit animated with chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, approached her, and gave her two boxes upon the eare, and at the ſame inſtant withered the roſes and lilies of her cheeks. I being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with this barbarous inſolence, and raſhneſs, that he had to uſe her ſo unworthily in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I went to him with my ſword in my hand, rebuking his brutality with offenſive words: He, who knew me not, drew alſo his ſword, and fighting one with another, I warded his blowes, and gave him two upon the body, which he could not avoid: then in deſpight of what they could all doe to ſtay me, I ſaved my ſelfe, and went out of the houſe without being known to any one,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54530:19"/>yet having a great deſire to know the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the names of theſe perſons, and the occaſion of theſe ſtrange aecidents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Louis,</hi> whom we call <hi>Poleron,</hi> was upon the paſſage of his hiſtory, when <hi>Clitor,</hi> and the Judge of the Towne entred into the priſon; the firſt, to ſee if the unknowne priſoner was of thoſe that did hurt <hi>Feniſe;</hi> and the other proteſting that he knew very well what belonged to his Office. They were all in ſuſpence to ſee what would be the iſſue of theſe words; but their attention was turned into affliction, knowing that his deſigne was to ſend them to <hi>Toledo.

                     </gap>eſtifying the exceſſe of his joy, he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54530:20"/>to ſpeak to her with the mute language of his eyes, which often expreſſe the feelings of the heart more intelligibly then the tongue can doe. <hi>Laure</hi> of her ſide, made ſuch ſignes with her eyes, as rendred faithfull proofs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of her love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Louis,</hi> who perceived all theſe amorous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſeeing that they were alone in this cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, having had licence of the Judge to viſit his friend, prayed them to explicate the <hi>Aenigmas</hi> of of their geſtures. <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſpoke, and told him; Deare friend, only in telling you the name of this perſon, ſhewing <hi>Laure,</hi> I anſwer to all the demands you can now make me, you having heard me ſo often ſpeak it. This is <hi>Laure,</hi> that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable beauty which hath charmed my ſoule: her preſence hath ſurprized me with ſo exceſſive a joy, that if it was not moderated with the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that I have, to ſee her ſuffer ſo many evils for my ſake, it would take away my life. Then turning himſelfe towards <hi>Laure;</hi> Ah deare object of my happineſſe, is it poſſible that my deſtiny may be appeaſed? Is it true that it is you? my imagination perpetually occupied with your i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, doth ſhe not deceive me? What, amongſt ſo many torments can I enjoy ſo extream a felicity? Without lying I have good cauſe to complain of your rigour, that hath hindred me ſo long time the enjoying thereof, in diſguiſing this night the delicious organ of your voice. Speak to me dear Miſtreſſe, let me ſee that my glory is not a dream; tell me what marvellous adventure hath reduced you to this miſery, which produced me ſo great
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54530:20"/>good fortune. <hi>Laure,</hi> who might rather be called <hi>Aurora,</hi> letting fall liquid pearls upon the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million roſes of her cheeks, anſwered him. My dear <hi>Feniſe,</hi> I have ſtriven much with my ſelf to uſe the diſſimulation whereof you complain, and &amp; hinder my ſelf from letting you know what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you had in your priſon: I wanted but a little of declaring my ſelfe when I ſaw you brought thither; but honour, which you know is ſo delicate a thing, obliged me to this ſevere retention; ſo that your love being guided by reſpect and civility, you have rather cauſe to be ſatisfied with me, then blame me. You cannot doubt of my paſſion, ſince that for to give you moſt particular aſſurances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I have violated paternall reſpect, and alſo that which I owe to my perſon, in giving occaſion to ſpeak to the prejudice of my vertue. But if our deſtiny have made us miraculouſly to meet againe, it ſeems it is but to run the ſame fortune, and make us hope for a more free conveniency to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine our ſelves, with the fortunes that have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived us ſince our ſeparation, the which obligeth me to pray you to give me leave to remit untill another time the ſatisfaction of your juſt curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Louis,</hi> who heard theſe diſcourſes, was ſo lively touched with compaſſion, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which he had to ſerve <hi>Feniſe,</hi> that he vowed from this moment to hazard all that he eſteemed, as well of his goods, as perſon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the tyranny of this barbarous Judge: And in the opinion which he had to come to the end of his deſign, he endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54530:21"/>
                     <hi>Laure,</hi> giving her hope that ſhe ſhould ſee her ſelf preſently at liberty with her Lover.</p>
                  <p>This comfortable friend having left them in this expectation, and being gone to put his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in execution, the impertinent Judge came to tell them he had changed his reſolution, and that it was not neceſſary to carry them both to <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;</hi> that for the love of <hi>Poleron</hi> he would leave <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe,</hi> and only take the other. At this advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Laure</hi> felt her heart gnawed cruelly, and revenging her misfortunes upon her ſelfe, let fall teares from her eyes which were able to have ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Marble. <hi>Feniſe</hi> on his ſide repented himſelfe for having ſo eaſily believed <hi>Don Louis,</hi> and for ſuffering himſelfe to be taken priſoner; he could not reſiſt the apprehenſions of his paſſion, nor <hi>Laure</hi> overcome the vehemency of her love; ſo that when ſhe ſaw her ſelfe untied from this poſt, ſhe approached her Lover, and without being ſeene of thoſe who were to carry her, ſhe fell vpon his neck for to embrace him: By good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune a ſwoond ſeized her at the inſtant, which ſtayed the effect of the Judges propoſition. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perceived this ſwoond, they took all care poſſible to remedy it, but not with ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but that the reſt of the day paſſed, which forced them to attend untill the morrow for to carry her to <hi>Toledo,</hi> judging that it was better to deferre it, then to hazard in the night the loſſe of a priſoner which might be taken from them in the dark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> beheld this image of death, whoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes he felt in his heart, nevertheleſſe he was

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54530:22"/>to the intermiſſion of a third perſon, to interpret his thoughts, not having courage enough to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to her that had made him conceive them. He uſed a very ordinary way, which was to apply himſelfe to the Chambermaide of this Lady, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe kinde of people are enemies that fight cloſe, they ſtrike almoſt alwaies where they pleaſe, and render the victory leſſe doubtfull: They ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more finde occaſions to praiſe the pretendant, and to preſent him to the perſon ſought after. <hi>Leonor</hi> had with her a witty wench called <hi>Amarante,</hi> which <hi>Felix</hi> knew to be able enough to render him good offices. He gave her preſents to incite her to favour his intentions: Liberalitie is the firſt vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Lover ought to be qualified. He declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her his paſſion, and the time when he begunne to feele it, the torment which be ſuffered, the qualities wherewith Nature had adorned him, the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the hopes of his fortune, being the onely Sonne of a very rich Father; becauſe theſe things are more freely ſpoken to thoſe who are imployed in ſuch buſineſſes, then to the perſons ſought after, who without doubt might have cauſe to eſteeme them impertinencies and preſumptions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amarante</hi> being very often entertained by this Gallant, had deſignes upon him, and determined to keep for her ſelfe, that which hee deſired by her organs to offer to <hi>Leonor;</hi> ſhee received his meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and gave him anſwers according to her minde. She entertained the unfortunate <hi>Felix</hi> with words, and hopes, falſe as from her Miſtreſſe, but true of her owne part: Making him beleeve, that if <hi>Leonor</hi> did not render him more certaine proofes of her
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54530:23"/>affection, hee ought to attribute it either to her feare of her Brother, or to her proper modeſty: Whilſt <hi>Felix</hi> thus perſevered in his pretenſions, and <hi>Leonor</hi> was ignorant thereof, <hi>Amarante</hi> invented wayes to enjoy her laſcivious affections. <hi>Felix</hi> ſpoke to her at a window almoſt every night, attributing the care and vigilance ſhe tooke to content him, to proceed from the preſents he daily gave her. Alaſſe deare <hi>Feniſe,</hi> I dare not blame the love of <hi>Amaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> for feare that by others I ſhew myſelfe culpable; I know one ought not accuſe the faults of Love, becauſe this paſſion blindes the judgement, and leaves but little place for reaſon, to conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences it breedeth, and to foreſee how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd them, but I doe not approve of the unjuſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this damoſell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Jovan</hi> was much troubled to have a man walke nightly about his houſe, but hee ſpoke not of it; from whence I preſume his paine was but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; for in ſuch diſpleaſures it is almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the most excellent prudence in the world, and the moſt ſtayed ſpirit to keepe it ſecret. One night deſiring to cleare his doubts, it befell him as to thoſe who are commonly too curious to know what they would be ignorant of. Hee hid himſelfe in his neighbours porch, and ſaw a ſigne given by the unknowne man, and at the ſame inſtant <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante</hi> appeared at the window, who told him that her Miſtreſſe could not come forth that night, but that the night following he ſhould ſpeake to her, and ſee her in her chamber. <hi>Felix</hi> having received theſe ſweet aſſurances, went his way very content with the hopes that he had to receive a recompence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54530:23"/>in ſo ſhort a time, which he could not hope for in many yeares. <hi>Don Jouan</hi> having heard what his confident had told him, ſeeing that the term of the returne of this Lover was not long, ſince that he was to come againe the night following, would not trouble himſelfe to follow him. He reſolved to be patient, and diſſemble what he thought, nevertheleſſe in the morning he took <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marante</hi> aſide, queſtioned her concerning the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which ſhe had with the unknowne, who, without enduring many threatnings, made an invention as extravagant as one blinded with love and ignorance could produce. She told him that <hi>Leonor</hi> loved a Cavalier called <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> who you may well know (ſaid ſhe) by his high birth, and that the night following, he was to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chamber of his Siſter by her intermiſſion, and the conſentment of <hi>Leonor;</hi> ſhe uſed this ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, thinking it would ſerve her to come to the end of her intentions, imagining that when <hi>Felix</hi> ſhould enter that ſhe ſhould put him into her bed, and when <hi>Don Jouan</hi> ſhould finde him there, he would conſtraine him to marry her, by that meanes ſhe ſhould quit <hi>Leonor</hi> of the infamy ſhe had laid upon her, and that her artifice would paſſe for gallantry.</p>
                  <p>The words which <hi>Don Jouan</hi> had heard the night before, and thoſe he now heard, had ſo much confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that he had no great difficulty to believe what ſhe ſaid, ſhe having confeſſed her ſelfe the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrix of their loves, he made her alſo promiſe to aſſiſt him to ſurprize <hi>Don Antonio</hi> when he ſhould be with his Siſter, to the end to oblige him to ſome convenient ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54530:24"/>
                  <p>In the interim, <hi>Felix</hi> impatient to poſſeſſe the glory he hoped for, paſſed the day with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes, ſo alſo did <hi>Don Jouan,</hi> but for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends; the one imagining how to come to the recompence of his paines, and the other how to hinder him. The night being come, <hi>Don Jouan</hi> hid himſelfe, and the poore girle thinking that ſhe had ſubtilly contrived her project, came to the window to attend the arrivall of the abuſed <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix. Leonor</hi> was come that night to lye with me in my chamber, as ſhe often did, which gave more way to <hi>Amarante,</hi> to abuſe the innocent <hi>Felix,</hi> whom ſhe hoped to make enter into the bed of <hi>Leonor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was come, ſhe opened him ſoftly a window, into which he mounted by the help of a Ladder of cords, from thence ſhe carried him into her Miſtreſſes chamber, and there left him without light, telling him he might have patience whileſt ſhe fetched her Miſtreſſe, ſpeaking very ſoftly for feare her voice ſhould make her known; She took <hi>Felix</hi> by the hand and put him in eſtate to come to the point of his deſires. <hi>Don Jouan,</hi> who lay in wait, believed when <hi>Amarante</hi> came againe, that it was her Siſter gave her leave to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her ſelfe of her Lover, but preſently entred the chamber, and without informing himſelfe of any thing, gave either of them a ſtab in the breaſt, ſo that the unfortunate <hi>Amarante,</hi> thinking to finde her Marriage-bed, found her Tombe. The blow which <hi>Felix</hi> had, was not in ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall a place but that he had force enough to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his armes, and obliged <hi>Don Iouan</hi> to doe the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54530:24"/>like to defend himſelfe, but in this violent agitation, the miſerable <hi>Felix</hi> advanced to his end, and tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led dead in ſtriving to get away.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time <hi>Don Jouan</hi> came into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I am not very certaine with what intention, but I am willing to believe that it was to warrant me from the danger I might be in, if the juſtices ſhould enter and know me: being entred and ſeeing his ſiſter with me; he ſtayed, confuſed and without ſpeaking a word, returned to ſee who the dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were. He knew <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Amarante,</hi> different perſons from thoſe whom he thought he had killed; he was extreamely amazed as well for the errour wherein he found himſelfe, as for the ſlaughter of this young man, being the onely ſonne of a very rich Merchant; who was able to imploy much money to puniſh him that ſhould be found authors of this crime. Perplexed with the horror of this murder, and feare of Juſtice, he abſented himſelfe before day, after having told us the mournefull act he had committed. And I being habited as you ſee with the ſame clothes wherein I came from my fathers, when I came to meete you in ſtead of my brother; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guid to <hi>Leonor,</hi> as if I had beene ſome valiant cavalier, and accompanied her to the houſe of one of her coſens with whome ſhe was to goe to <hi>Heride</hi> a towne in <hi>Catalogne</hi> where one of her Vncles dwelt; becauſe ſhe was reſolved to ſtay no longer with <hi>Don Iouan,</hi> not being able to forget the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he had thought to have executed upon her perſon.</p>
                  <p>See the misfortune that arrived in this great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by the impertinent art of a domeſtique of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54530:25"/>experience which makes me ſay, that it is ſit, that the ſeſrvants of an honorable houſe ſhould be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as well as their miſtreſſes, otherwiſe they are capable to corrupt the daughters or mothers whom they ſerve, and bring them to tragique ends with the loſſe of their honour and generall infamy of their familie. I tooke leave of <hi>Leonor</hi> at the dore of the houſe, where I left her, and immediately by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the obſcuritie I came by theſe mountaines and valleys, ſearching ſome village where I might in this diſguiſement hide my ſelfe from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my brothers, and attend untill it pleaſed heaven to moderate the rigours of my deſtiny: The little knowledge which I had of the country, which is full of buſhes, hilles, and precipices, was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I loſt my ſelfe, and that the Juſtices of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage light upon me; who led me ſo happily to this priſon, where without thinking thereof, I found that which to me is the moſt delightful in this world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> lifted up his eyes and ſhoulders, aſtoniſhed with this ſtrange accident, nevertheleſſe he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great pleaſure in the harmony of the words of <hi>Laure.</hi> And alſo to ſatisfie her on his parte, he told her all which was befalne him untill their common good fortune had brought them together. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ended, they begun to reaſon upon the actions of <hi>Don Iouan</hi> who after the murder of <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante</hi> came unto the chamber of <hi>Laure,</hi> judging that he had ſome deſigne againſt the reſpect he ought to his friend, and integritie of <hi>Laure,</hi> his miſtreſſe.</p>
                  <p>The halfe of this night was almoſt ſpent in theſe entertaines. In the intrim, <hi>Don Louis</hi> ſlept not but laboured for their deliverances as they preſently ſaw
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54530:25"/>the effect thereof. Wee told you before that this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon joyned upon the houſe of the ſayned <hi>Poleron,</hi> but you muſt know that there was but a thin wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them two, made of joyſts and bricks; ſo that it was eaſy enough for him to execute his deſigne: ſo that when he thought them to be in their firſt ſleepe who guarded the priſoners, he broke this wall without noiſe, with a crow of Iron made a hole big enough, went into the chamber, and with other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron inſtruments, broke the lockes which held <hi>Laure</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> chained to the poſt, and delivered them from this rigorous captivitie.</p>
                  <p>Being gone out of this infamous place he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Laure</hi> to ſhew her ſelfe couragious in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then they mounted every one upon a good horſe, &amp; <hi>Don Louis</hi> ſerved them for guide; they tooke the way to <hi>Toledo</hi> thinking that they would not ſearch after them that way; having teſtified to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend very much their going thither, as the ſwoond of <hi>Laure</hi> had ſhewed. Before <hi>Aurora</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven place to the ſunne, they found themſelves neere the towne; They determined not to enter therein, for feare of ſome inconvenience, but to goe on to the farmes which are thereabouts, which are caled <hi>Ciga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales,</hi> the ſame farmers houſe, whither we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you, <hi>Feniſe</hi> had before retired himſelfe; this was accordingly executed; and the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Don Louis</hi> went to viſit <hi>Feniſe</hi> his father on the behalfe of the ſonne, and to receive his commands, but not to acquaint him that he was with <hi>Laure,</hi> as they had agreed together. For the hatred which <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronte,</hi> (ſo was the name of this cavalier) bore to her Familie was ſo violent, that he would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54530:26"/>abandoned his ſonne, if he ſhould have known there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He received this Embaſſador with great joy, and without making him ſtay too long, he made one of his ſervants take a horſe, and gave him good ſtore of money, and commanded him to follow <hi>Don Louis</hi> and to give the money and the horſe to his ſonne, with a letter whereby he ordayned him to goe to <hi>Valence,</hi> and to ſtay there untill he heard further commands from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> was well ſatisfied with the returne of his friende, having received by his meanes news of his Fathers health, and witneſſes of his affection. Hee tooke the horſe and treaſure, and for many conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, hee ſent back preſently his Fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, becauſe when a ſecret is known to many, it is hard to keepe it; immediately after they all three tooke horſe and went towards <hi>Valence. Don Lovis</hi> was then habited like a Cavalier, having clothed himſelfe at <hi>Toledo,</hi> before hee went to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They went ſo merrily, that ſome miſchiefe was to bee feared; for it ſucceeds ordinarily after great contentment. Without doubt the Philoſopher had experienced this, who deſired ſorrow, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red joy: Becauſe, ſaid hee, after Melancholy a man may hope for Mirth, but after Mirth hee can have nothing but vexation. The affection of <hi>Feniſe</hi> and <hi>Leure</hi> increaſed every minute by the mutuall pleaſure which they received in their converſation, whereby they grew more acquainted the one with the other; <hi>Don Lovis</hi> tooke an incomparable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in hearing their diſcourſes, and ſeeing their pretty behaviours, wherein <hi>Feniſe</hi> inviolably kept
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54530:26"/>all the reſpect that could bee deſired; he acted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but with honour and reſpect. They had not above one dayes journey to <hi>Valence,</hi> when <hi>Laure</hi> prayed <hi>Don Lovis</hi> to finiſh his Hiſtory which he had begunne, and he being extreamely obliging, begun where he was interrupted by the ruſtique Judge, and thus continued.</p>

                  <head>THE CONTIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ANCE OF THE HISTORY OF <hi>DON LOUIS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>YOu may remember the pitifull eſtate of this noble Family, amongſt ſo many diſaſters; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without repeating that diſcourſe, I will onely tell you, that being happily gotten out of the houſe, without being known, my Love made me ſtay ſix whole dayes in <hi>Barcelone,</hi> where I learnt that the old hurt man was father of the beauty which had ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched me; a Gentleman of a great extraction, and very rich; that hee recovered by little and little; but he who I chaſtiſed for his inſolence was dead, and that he was brother to this Lady called <hi>Hipolite,</hi> moſt wiſe and vertuous.</p>
                  <p>All theſe conſiderations and high qualities made me judge, that I ſet upon a place too hard to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but my love was come to ſuch a point, that it was impoſſible for me not to adore that divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I would not informe my ſelfe more exactly, for feare of giving ſuſpition to my prejudice. I muſt be contented to goe and come before her lodging,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54530:27"/>to endeavour to get a view of her, although I knew her ſight would but augment my pain.</p>
                  <p>All my diligence and care was inutile, ſhe led ſo recluſe a life, that I could not ſee her otherwiſe, but with the eyes of mine imagination; there was no other remedy for my torments, but to wiſh death, or to baniſh this celeſtiall Image from my memory, but all theſe deſires and propoſitions had no effect; I could neither dye nor forget her. In the end, as love findes out inventions as well as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, it came into my fancy to make acquaintance with one of the domeſtiques, and to oblige him by liberalitie, to procure me ſome aleagement. There was in the houſe a young man who was Steward, and ſometimes ſerved for Uſher, whoſe name was <hi>Octave,</hi> I prevailed ſo much with my promiſes and gifts, that I got his acquaintance and affection, and by this meanes an acceſſe free enough into the houſe, without fearing the murmur of the neighbours, who hold their peace at good things, though they know them to be ſo, but publiſh that which is ill, though they but doubt thereof. I ſaw often the faire cauſe of my inquietudes, but could not finde an occaſion favourable to ſpeake to her. Seeing me often frequent <hi>Octave,</hi> and perceiving I negar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her too attentively to be without deſigne, ſhee tooke notice of my behaviour and actions, and ſince gave me ſome ſignes of hope. From thence I took the boldneſſe to declare unto her my paſſion, by the ſecreet language of a Letter, which I made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. At the firſt ſhe ſhewed her ſelf very angry with my audaciouſneſſe; nevertheleſſe I did not forbear to ſend her a ſecond, which was more happy than
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54530:27"/>the firſt, ſince that ſhee had the curioſity to ſee it and boldneſſe to make mee an anſwer: The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe thereof was very ſuccinct, but yet ample e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make me hope a glorious ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſeeing my ſelfe thus favoured, was incouraged to goe on, perſwading my ſelfe that a Lady that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth her ſelfe engaged, would not be long in acquitting her ſelfe thereof. <hi>Octave</hi> being intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in my contentments, tooke often occaſion to ſpeake well of me in the preſence of <hi>Hipolite,</hi> and at ſuch houres, when ſhe could beſt give eare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſo that by little and little ſhe became more ſenſible of the power of Love. One day ſhe faigned her ſelfe extreamely melancholique, which obliged her Father, who loved her dearly, to take her into the country to recreate her ſpirits, by the change of aire. <hi>Octave</hi> gave mee notice of this deſigne, and told me the day when, and place whither they went, which was to a village that belonged to them. I diſpoſed my ſelfe to follow the light of mine eies, and the felicitie of my life, which had a happy iſſue, for the libertie which they take in that country to walke, ſometimes neare a Fountaine, ſometimes near a Meadow, Wood, or Garden, gave me opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty often to come neare her, and endeavour to make her accept my ſervices.</p>
                  <p>Not long after her arrivall, the Townſmen made certaine games after their manner, where I appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54530:28"/>repreſent unto you the raviſhment of this charming converſation; for there is nothing in the world ſo ſweet as beginning of Love. But as after pleaſures diſcontentments ſucceed, this felicitie laſted not long: The day following they muſt return to <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About a League from the Towne, <hi>Leoncio,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Hipolite,</hi> her ſelfe, and the whole Family were inveſted by a Troope of men armed with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabines, who came to affront <hi>Leoncio.</hi> He had an old quarrell againſt agreat Cavalier, who had watched him to ſatisfie his hatred. The Father of <hi>Hipolite</hi> who defyed his enemy, kept himſelfe upon his guard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies accompanied with his Kinſmen and Friends, as well as his adverſary; though not in ſo great number, yet more valiant. The contrary Troope ſeeing themſelves the more, ſent three of their men to the Coach of <hi>Hipolite</hi> to ſeiſe upon her perſon, whilſt the reſt ſet upon and preſſed <hi>Leoncio,</hi> who had left his Daughter to aſſiſt his party.</p>
                  <p>Moſt inſolently they made this young Lady to quit her Coach, and ſet her upon a Hackney, and carryed her away as the moſt glorious Trophee they could take from their enemies. By ill fortune I was not neare her at this time, I ſtayed behinde, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with <hi>Octave</hi> of mine amorous adventures; but as we drew towards the Towne, wee ſaw coming the object of my contentment, in the hands of her enemies. Oh God! cryed <hi>Octave,</hi> there is ſome great misfortune arrived; ſee the Kinſmen of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of <hi>Leoncio,</hi> who carry away <hi>Hipolite,</hi> let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne behinde theſe buſhes, and get before them; we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54530:28"/>did accordingly, and put our ſelves in ambuſh in a certaine paſſage, where whilſt we attended them, <hi>Octave</hi> told me the cauſe of the quarrell; when they came to paſſe by us, we ran upon them with our ſwords in our hands, crying to me, to me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, they are here, feigning that we were a greater number, wherewith they were ſo frighted, that they left their conqueſt, and fled, except one which ſtayed upon the place, to pay with his bloud and life, for the inſolence which he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions had committed. After this action wee went to <hi>Hipolite,</hi> whom we found half dead, as well with the feare which ſhe had of her enemies, as that which we had cauſed her, for ſhe knew not that this was <hi>Octave,</hi> and my ſelf, which had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her from her raviſhers.</p>
                  <p>She was raviſhed with joy to ſee us, but yet this gladneſſe was mingled with diſpleaſure: ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a hurt which I had received upon the head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling it, by reaſon of my action. In the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im <hi>Leoncio</hi> aſſiſted by the valour of his friends had on the other ſide given the chaſe to his enemies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all come together againe, <hi>Octave</hi> recited to him our good fortune; thereupon <hi>Leoncio,</hi> thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, obliged to me, would needs have me taken care of in his houſe, to the end to have more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſerve me. I made him many comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet nevertheleſſe I ſhould haue been very ſorry to have refuſed ſo advantagious a gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince by that meanes I ſhould have occaſion to ſee more commodiouſly <hi>Hipolite:</hi> But to my diſgrace my hurt was too ſoone healed, and as pleaſures of this World dure but a ſhort time,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54530:29"/>ſo was I in civility forced to leave the abode of my affections, and entertaine my deſires as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, I was told that there was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier of <hi>Barcelone,</hi> called <hi>Don Vincence d' Aualois,</hi> of eminent qualitie, a handſome man, of a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable wit, and rich condition, who ſought after <hi>Hipolite,</hi> with deſigne to marry her. He had not yet let her know of his affections, but having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her parents therewith, he took liberty to publiſh them, ſo farre as to compoſe verſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſubject, to give her muſick, which was as troubleſome to me, as pleaſing to others: As one time amongſt others I thought to enjoy the deare entertaine of <hi>Hipolite,</hi> ſhe having appointed me a certain houre to ſee her by a window, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the iron bars had been often witneſſes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors ſhe had done me: As I approached to this place, followed by <hi>Octave,</hi> we heard many inſtruments tuning, which obliged us to ſtay: it was <hi>Don Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> who teſtified his eſteeme of an Ebony Ring which <hi>Hipolite</hi> had worne, and which he had got by craft from one of her ſervants, having given her a gold chain in exchange.</p>
                  <p>This Conſort was ſo melodious, that another would have been charmed therewith; but jealouſie, which beat me, rendred this harmony ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that I wanted not much of making an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare in the ſtreet, audaciouſly enterpriſing to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their mirth, and chaſe the Muſes from thence. The prudent advice of <hi>Octave</hi> moderated mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he counſelled me to attend untill <hi>DonVincence</hi> had made his ſerenade, and after he was retired, I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54530:29"/>might approach to <hi>Hipolite's</hi> Window. I governed my ſelfe by his advice, which ſucceeded happily: <hi>Hipolite</hi> let me know by her diſcourſes, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe had heard the muſick, ſhe did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was for her, but for another Lady her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the which contented me much. In our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes I repreſented unto her that I had ſerved her foure yeares, and that this conſtancy merited the performance of the promiſes ſhe had made me. Thereupon ſhe anſwered, that ingratitude never had commerce with her, and that ſhe was alwayes diſpoſed to give me thoſe ſatisfactions I could hope from my ſervices, that I was to finde an invention to get into the houſe, and keep my ſelf in <hi>Octaves</hi> chamber, which being done, ſhe would take care for the reſt. As ſhe gave me theſe inſtructions, we heard ſome people in the ſtreet, which obliged me to take leave of her, and to retire my ſelf with all the contentment that could be preſumed from ſo glorious hopes.</p>
                  <p>I left her, and went to ſearch <hi>Octave,</hi> in turning at the corner of the ſtreet, I perceived that thoſe who had made the brute which ſeparated <hi>Hipolite</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aw <hi>Octave</hi> the next morning, he told me the great
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54530:30"/>complaint that ſhe made of my negligence, and that this was ſuch an occaſion as it might be I ſhould not meet with in my whole life: That for his part he could not aſſiſt me no more in ſuch occaſions, becauſe <hi>Leoncio</hi> had commanded him to go to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lands of his, to make a receiver give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; that it was not permitted him to defer his departure; that I muſt be ſilent, and ſuffer untill his returne, having none but him that could manage my good fortune.</p>
                  <p>He was a moneth abſent, during which time it was impoſſible for me to ſee <hi>Hipolite,</hi> not for want of diligence, or care, but of occaſion. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim <hi>Don Vincenſe,</hi> whoſe love increaſed, preſſed the father of <hi>Hipolite</hi> to reſolve upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he had made him. <hi>Leoncio</hi> ſeeing a match ſo advantagious for his daughter, and the equality of their conditions, after having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to his kindred and friends, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Cavalier what he deſired, without demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſent of her that had the moſt intereſt therein, thinking it unneceſſary to a daughter, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obedient as <hi>Hipolite</hi> was, for he did believe that her conſent would always depend upon his. Oh the great errors of Fathers, to think that a vertuous daughter ought to be deprived of her choiſe and will! In fine, <hi>Leoncio</hi> told her no more of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, but that he had married her: She was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed with ſo ſhort an oration, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her Father to expreſſe himſelfe a little more amply, he told her the perſon, admoniſhed her to diſpoſe her ſelfe to this new change of condition, as alſo to put on her beſt ornaments, and to look
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54530:30"/>cheerfully, for, ſaid he, contentment is the moſt excellent paint wherewith a woman can beautifie her ſelfe. Having thus perſwaded her, he left her; but in ſtead of preparing her ſelfe for joy, ſhe abandoned her ſelfe to ſighs and teares.</p>
                  <p>At that time I went often to her houſe, as well for to ſeek ſome favourable moment to ſpeake to her, as for to learne if <hi>Octave</hi> was returned from his voyage. The laſt time that I was there, I ſaw at the doore many Lacquees in the ſame Livery; this expence teſtified that they appertained to a Maſter of great condition: I was aſtoniſhed with this novelty, and entring for to know the cauſe thereof, I found <hi>Octave,</hi> who was newly arrived, who (in ſtead of approaching me with joy) look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſadly upon me, that he gave me cauſe to ſuſpect that there was ſomething to be done to my prejudice; I ſaluted him in embracing him, and asked him the explication of what I had ſeen; but without daring to regard me, he anſwered, that being my moſt affectionate ſervant, he deſired to be excuſed from interpreting things ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The longer he deferred to ſatisfie me, the more I preſſed him, in the end my importunity drew from him theſe words, goe above into the Hall, ſaid he, and you ſhall ſee the ſubject of my affliction. The generall joy of thoſe who were invited, wherewith the place was almoſt filled, gave me occaſion to enter without being noted. I ſaw <hi>Hipolite</hi> in the middle of a circle of Ladies, ſhining like a Sun: on another ſide <hi>Don Vincence,</hi> my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, with a countenance that teſtified his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Finding things in this order, I was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54530:31"/>confirmed in the opinion which I had conceived. I put my ſelfe in a place where I might be ſeen of <hi>Hipolie,</hi> to the end ſhe might make an end to deſtroy me, which had arrived without doubt, if I had not been ſo infortunate, that when I ſearch torments, they flye me. She lifted up her eyes, and ſeeing me, it was impoſſible for her to retaine her teares, which ſhe hid the moſt diſcreetly ſhe could; thereupon he arrived who was to adminiſter to them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and joyne their hands and wills; but when as they came to entreat <hi>Hipolite</hi> to approach, ſhe begun to talk ſo extravagantly, that all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was affrighted. She blamed her Father, offended her Kindred, ſpoke injurious againſt <hi>Vincence.</hi> O extreame puiſſance of an amorous paſſion, capable to alienate the ſpirit of the wiſeſt! In a word, ſhee became ſenceleſſe, to the great confuſion of all the company, and principally of the Gentleman that pretended to marry her: ſhe named and called me every moment, ſayd that I was he, for whom hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had ordained her, and that I ought onely to poſſeſſe her. I found my ſelfe much troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe ſtrange confuſions, and fearing ſome danger, ſlipt behinde a piece of hangings, by which meanes I got out of the houſe, without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. When ſhe had loſt the ſight of me, ſhe begun to run about the Hall to ſeek me, but not finding me, ſo violent a griefe ſeiſed her, that ſhe fell in a trance. They carryed her to a bed, where after a little time, ſhe came to her ſelf again, but with a burning feaver. Al the company departed very Melancolique, and alſo <hi>Don-Vincence</hi> full of deſpite and deſpaire, and <hi>Don-Leoncio</hi> ſuffered himſelfe to bee ſurpriſed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54530:31"/>with ſo great vexation, that hee dyed within foure dayes, leaving to her Brother the care of <hi>Hipolite,</hi> and the Adminiſtration of his Goods.</p>
                  <p>See the unfortunate ſucceſſes of my Loves, whoſe image will be perpetually engraven in my heart, ſee how my hopes were converted into ſmoake, which may ſerve for an example to conſider the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of humane felicity. After this I retired my ſelfe into that country place where I had the honour to beginne my acquaintance with you, thinking that I might there live quietly the reſt of my life, ſince I have been eſtabliſhed in that courſe of life; <hi>Octave</hi> writ to me that <hi>Hipolite</hi> continued in the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate that I had left her in; but I am not in the ſame condition I was then, my Flames are doubly encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they augment every moment, ſeeing how much I owe to her faith and conſtancy, ſo that I now love more madly than ever; neither abſence nor time can deface it from my memory. During the time of my abode in that village, I courted a Shepheardeſſe honoured amongſt all the mountaines of <hi>Toledo,</hi> but it was but for to entertain my ſpirit (although ſhe be perfect, I did but imagine that I treated with <hi>Hipolite.</hi>) So I paſſed my time when you arrived there deare <hi>Feniſe,</hi> and when I was ſo happy to finde an occaſion to ſerve you, which I ſhall take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in all my life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Lovis</hi> thus ending the Hiſtory of his Loves, they were within a League of the towne of <hi>Valence,</hi> but it was very late, which obliged them to make haſte, for feare of being benighted. But they had ſcarcely begunne this laſt League, when they heard amongſt the Orange trees which grew by the way
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54530:32"/>ſide, whereof that paſſage was full, a plaintife voice, the which with violent ſighing ſeemed to deſire to render the aire ſenſible of his ſorrow; they ſtayed to heare the words which he ſpoke, afterwards they came neare him, and ſaw a man ſtretched upon the the earth, in appearance near the end of his life; at this object generous and charitable <hi>Feniſe</hi> lighted, tyed his horſe to a tree, and demanded of this miſerable one the cauſe of his plaints. <hi>Don Levis</hi> and <hi>Laure</hi> did the like, and accompanied <hi>Feniſe,</hi> when this infortunate ſpoke theſe words; Cavalier, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you are, I am ſo neare mine end, that what diligence ſoever you can take to ſuccour me, will but little profit me; it muſt be a force more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>umane which muſt reduce me from the pain I am in; yet nevertheleſſe I will take courage: Saying ſo, he endeavoured to riſe, and <hi>Lovis</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him. When he ſaw himſelf up, and ſupported by theſe two Cavaliers, he cryed out louder than before, and thereupon came two men who fell upon <hi>Feniſe</hi> and <hi>Don Lovis,</hi> who being aſſiſted with him who counterfeited the dying man, bound and tyed them to two truncks of trees, at the ſame time they went to <hi>Laure,</hi> who was half dead with feare, ſeiſed upon her, and one of the three having known her, ſaid to the others, Courage my friends, I have found what I ſearched for; then taking the horſe upon the which the head of the Troope was come, they ſet <hi>Laure</hi> upon him, tied her, and made her ride before them. Thus they abandoned the two priſoners to the mercy of their fortune, without taking either Armes or Horſes, to let them know, that they who had raviſhed <hi>Laure</hi> from them, were
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54530:32"/>perſons that ſcorned ſo poore a booty.</p>
                  <p>It would be more preſumption then eloquence, to goe about to deſcribe the feelings of <hi>Feniſe</hi> and <hi>Laure,</hi> ſeeing themſelves ſo cruelly ſeparated the one from the other. A ſpirit weaker then that of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe,</hi> would have beene dejected with ſo ſenſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures; ſeeing him ſelfe tyed and deprived of all meanes to recover his deere <hi>Laure,</hi> who was carryed away like a priſoner. She on the other ſide fell into teares and ſighes which were able to have given ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of pitty, to any thing which is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deprived thereof; ſhe imployed all her force to unty her ſelfe, to the end to be revenged upon her ſelfe, ſo far had deſpaire tranſported her. The ſilence and imagination of the reader muſt ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults of the diſcourſe for the pen cannot lively e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough repreſent an adventure ſo deplorable. <hi>Don Louis</hi> almoſt forgot his proper diſpleaſures, to take part of the griefes of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> yet without comforting of him, for as much as conſolation cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in violent afflictions, and it is a great ſecret to let paſſe the firſt violences. Theſe Cavaliers had ſuffered this miſery almoſt halfe an houre: when <hi>Don Louis</hi> by violent moving and tormenting him ſelfe had ſlackned his cords, and not long after found meanes to loſe himſelfe. <hi>Feniſe</hi> uſed the like dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but he could not arrive to his end ſo ſoone as <hi>Don Louis,</hi> who was ſtrong, and who knew how to adde induſtry to force, having ſet himſelfe at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he alſo delivered <hi>Fenise,</hi> they mounted upon their horſes, ride after the raviſhers of <hi>Laure,</hi> reſolved to dye or to overcome, and to take from them this glorious conqueſt. But they had not ridden far;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54530:33"/>when they were met by two horſemen, who they did believe fled, or purſued after ſome that fied from them, they were confirmed in this opinion, hearing one of them haſtily utter theſe words: ſee the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, kill them, kill them, <hi>Marcell</hi> ſince we have reaſon of our ſide it is requiſit that their blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire their treachery. <hi>Don Louis</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> were much aſtoniſhed at this language, and for to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant themſelves from inconvenience they lighted, and put themſelves in a poſture of defence. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſeeing them thus reſolved, imagined them to be thoſe they looked for, then being carryed away with the exceſſe of their paſſion, and more blinded with choller then the darknes of the night, begun to ſet upon them with a great deale of raſhneſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they were advantagiouſly armed. And in effect, if heaven the protector of innocents had not had care of <hi>Feniſe</hi> and <hi>Louis,</hi> they would have beene in danger to have beene ſacrificed to the anger of these unknowne. It happened that there was a little run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle betwitxt them which ſtayed the courſe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell:</hi> and as he came to paſſe it, he fell into a pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, from whence he was long before he could retire himſelfe. His companion, called <hi>Leonard,</hi> found a happier paſſage; but which had like to have beene that of his death, for he found himſelfe betwixt two enemies, and without the good armes wherewith he was covered, he had preſently ſeene his raſhneſſe payd with his blood; in the interim, <hi>Marcell</hi> got out of the bog, and came to his defence. <hi>Don Louis</hi> ſeeing him come, left <hi>Feniſe</hi> before <hi>Leonard,</hi> and went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, crying hither, hither inconſiderate, to me, to me, heaven will ſerve it ſelfe with my arme to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54530:33"/>chaſtiſe thy inſolence; at the ſound of theſe words <hi>Marcell</hi> knew that his companion and himſelfe were deceived, and that they fought not againſt thoſe they ſought for: he retired himſelfe and cryed to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onard</hi> who was fighting with <hi>Feniſe,</hi> that he ſhould make truce advertiſing him of the fault which his inconſideration had made him commit, in falling upon men they had nothing to demand of. At the inſtant <hi>Leonard</hi> ceaſed to preſſe his adverſary, who was already very weary and hurt, and lighting left his armes &amp; went to ſuccour him; the hurt of <hi>Feniſe</hi> was upon his right, ſide, but it was given him in gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which was the cauſe that it entred not much into his body and in a place which was not mortall. They demanded pardon one of an other, and thoſe who did before endeavour to take away one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lives, uſed then all diligence to conſerve them. For this effect they tooke the way to <hi>Valence,</hi> the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the one, and the infortunate end of the others journey. <hi>Leonard</hi> extreamely afflicted with the hurt of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> did not ceaſe to make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and excuſes, and to teſtifie to him the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſorrow which he had for what was happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he conjured <hi>Feniſe</hi> to take his lodging, to the end he might endeavour by the ſervices which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to render him during the time of his indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to merit the honour of his affection. <hi>Feniſe</hi> uſed the ſame courteſie of his ſide; told him that he eſteemed his blood well imployed ſince that it had got him the acquaintance of ſo generous a Cavalier, to whoſe valour he had deſigne to have recourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions that ſhould preſent themſelves: they thus entertained themſelves by the way, when <hi>Don
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54530:34"/>Louis</hi> ſaid to <hi>Leonard</hi> and <hi>Marcell,</hi> that if they were willing to give them more certaine proofes of their freedome they would not reject the prayer which they made to them, to recite the cauſe of the great precipitation wherewith they ſet upon them, without knowing to whom they addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe <hi>Feniſe</hi> would take delight in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall; if it be true that there is conſolation in the company of thoſe that are touched with the ſame afflictions that we are. <hi>Leonard</hi> then ſpake as being the moſt qualified. I would freely tell you, anſwered he, the cauſe of the too blamable raſhnes which I have committed, if this relation might not be received as a teſtimony of the honour which I beare you, hoping that greater occaſions ſhall be preſented wherein I may manifeſt it, but the feare I have to trouble this hurt Cavalier doth oblige me to excuſe my ſelfe from ſatisfying your curioſitie.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Feniſe</hi> added his prayers to thoſe of <hi>Lovis,</hi> and at the ſame inſtant <hi>Leonard</hi> made them this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>THe towne of <hi>Valence</hi> whither we are going, is the place of my birth, and ancient dwelling of my Anceſtours: If I be not of the greateſt families, at the leaſt I am of the moſt noble, with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions which my father and mother left me, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this world to goe to a better life, they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me with the care and guard of two Siſters, who
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54530:34"/>had the reputation to bee of the number of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, not onely of the towne, but of the Province, as they grew up, my cares augmented; and in truth it is a dangerous charge to guard a fair Maid: I had an eie perpetually to conſerve their honours, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my fraternal obligation, mine was therin enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. I was alwaies putting them in minde of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the illuſtrious Ladies of our linage, to induce them to imitate the puritie of their lives. The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt was called <hi>Eufemie,</hi> and if I be not a partiall Judge, I may ſay that her graces and beauty were incomparable. Seeing her fit for marriage, there paſſed not many dayes before I deſired her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve thereupon; and to excite her thereunto, I repreſented unto her, that the beauty of a Maide, was a flowre expoſed to the deſires of a thouſand Gallants, who would endeavour to ſtaine the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof. She was ſo eaſily perſwaded by my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and rendered her will ſo conformable to mine, that I ſometimes doubted if wee had two ſoules. I propounded unto her parties which I thought moſt convenient for her condition, for to diſpoſe her ſelfe thereunto according to her liking, for a maide ought never to be conſtrained, ſhe ſhould be free in that election. After that ſhe had maturely conſidered thereof in her particular, ſhee made choice of a Cavalier called <hi>Don Alonſo de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lloa,</hi> whoſe Merits and Qualities were correſpondent to hers.</p>
                  <p>At that time, when I treated of theſe affaires, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of youth, which makes almoſt all young men commit extravagancies, carryed me in the day to the converſation of my friends, and in the night to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54530:35"/>thoſe Academies where they cut away the renowne of the moſt honeſt men, where they raviſh the goods of others, and where many vices are learned. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes loſt my money, when I ſet downe to play, it is true, that there is not much difference betwixt playing and loſing, ſince that to expreſſe that a man hath loſt his eſtate, we ordinarily ſay, that he hath played it. One night a Gentleman, with whom I played, quarrelled with me, almoſt without cauſe; from words we came to a challenge, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon the place where we were to fight, we met there almoſt at the ſame inſtant, Fortune was more favourable to me than to my adverſary; I doe not ſay that I had more valour; for he that hath a heart to meaſure his ſword with anothers, ought to be eſteemed as valiant, although he hath the worſe. The combat was ſo advantagious to me, that I tamed the pride of mine enemy, and made him kiſſe the ſame place he had already bedewed with his blood.</p>
                  <p>This Cavalier had a brother, which had a deſign to affront me, to raviſh from me the glory I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to the confuſion of his Kinſman, who ſeeing he could not execute his vengeance upon me, he inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt infamous and cowardly one that is poſſible to be conceived by the moſt infamous of men. He reſolved to make love to my Siſter, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame her honour and ruine mine; a new and cruell method to kill a man. He found occaſions enough to execute this miſchievous project; he tooke the time of my abſence in a voyage which I muſt needs make to the Court; ſo that not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the neceſsary watch to guard the Citadell,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54530:35"/>this traytor moſt induſtriouſly made himſelfe maſter thereof. <hi>Eufemye</hi> rendered her ſelf at his diſcretion; but let us excuſe this fault, which might be cauſed by her youth, liberty, beauty, delights, ſolitude, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous diſcourſes, inflamed letters, ſervices, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of deceitfull ſinceritie, the perſwaſions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, her proper paſſions, or thoſe who have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore experimented thoſe things, tell me, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance can a maide make that is ſet upon ſo many wayes? <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſo was this perfideous called, did not content himſelf with taking from her that which was moſt pretious, but ſtole her away from my lodging, and being furniſhed with things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, carryed her to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where being arrived, he told her he had no intention to entertaine her there. But Gentlemen, be not aſtoniſhed, if in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you the reſt, I hide my face for ſhame. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided her a houſe proper to receive viſits, it is the faſhion to ſpeak thus of ſuch kinde of people to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe their infamy: I take the boldneſſe to ſpeak thus freely hoping in the conſequence of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, you will ſee that I am not guiltie of theſe enormious delights, and that you ſhall by and by know the diligence that I have taken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face them from my gentilitie. In a word, <hi>Eufemy,</hi> who might now more properly be called infamy, became one of the moſt famous Curtizans; the moſt courted, and the leaſt reſerved: Oh prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous change of life! what aſtoniſhment was it to thoſe, who had before ſeen her in her retained courſe of life, and then abandoned to all ſorts of liberty, to thoſe who had praiſed her honeſty, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered her ſo diſordered, to thoſe, I ſay, who had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54530:36"/>ſeene her make ſcruple to be regarded onely by the ſun, now to ſee her ſo viſited, that ſhe was never one moment without company.</p>
                  <p>

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtayed there ſome time, a young gentlewoman of condition and very rich, bore me ſome affection and by this meeting I was confirmed in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I had, that love is a conjunction of ſtarts, whoſe conformity infuſeth affections into the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>I wholly imployed my ſelfe, then to ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tyrants of mine honour, I enquired after them of all my friends, preſuming to heare ſomething in <hi>Madrid,</hi> amongſt the confuſion of the court, which for refuge to ſo many ſortes of perſons, but all my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences were vaine.</p>
                  <p>During this exerciſe, one day as I went in the towne, a woman came to me and asked me my name, and I having told it her; ſhe drew a letter from her boſome, put it in my hand and without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me leiſure to informe my ſelfe from whence ſhe came: reade this letter, ſaid ſhe, and neglect not your good fortune; when ſhe is ſo inclined to favour you.

I imagine that the merit of a gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of honour may oblige you to this courteſie; but I hope more from the nobleneſſe of your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

                  <p>In ending the reading of this letter, I begun to be ignorant of the author, and the confuſion wherein I was, made me wiſh that the terme which ſhee had given me was expired to be delivered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. I paſſed the night in this impatience, and the houre being come I rendered my ſelfe at the place aſſigned, where I preſently ſaw arrive too women who had their faces covered with cipreſſe, which I did not thinke ſtrange becauſe it was the faſhion, put I was aſtoniſhed with the brightnes of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one of theſe women, which ſhe permitted me to ſee, in letting fall her vaile upon her ſhoulder, as not thinking thereof, and lifting it up againe at the ſame time, I remained as immoveable at the ſplendour of this object; and as this had vailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54530:37"/>her face, the other diſcovered hers, thereby to let me know that it was ſhe that had brought me the Letter. Then I thought it convenient to premeditate ſome little diſcourſe wherewith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach this Beauty, for he doth much that is able to paſſe the firſt incounter of a faire Lady with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and without committing ſome impertinency.</p>
                  <p>Then animating my reſolution, and uſing all all the courteſie I could poſſible, I ſaid to her; Madam, if I be too bold thus to accoſt you, the confuſion which this paper hath given me, and this meſſenger which brought it me, may ſerve me for excuſe. I have learned by the diſcourſe thereof, that Heaven is willing to render mee worthy to ſerve you, and that you deſired that I might come hither to receive the honour of your commands: And ſince that I am come, and have ſeen, there reſts nothing but to overcome the obſtacles, which would oppoſe themſelves to your contentment, as I ſhall doe without doubt when you ordaine mee. Then this Lady againe diſcovered her admirable countenance, and looking upon me with gracious eyes, Cavalier, ſaid ſhe, I eſteem my ſelf much indebted to your courteſie, which merits more praiſe then excuſe; but I blame her who hath cauſed you to come hither, and whoſe imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility hath at this time ſo greatly prejudiced mine honour. Saying ſo, ſhe turned towards <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,</hi> ſo was ſhe called that accompanied her, and ſeverely chid her: Shee who was prepared of what ſhe ought to ſay, made a thouſand excuſes to <hi>Teo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> this was the name of that Lady, who coming againe to me, ſpoke this language; I muſt confeſſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54530:37"/>I writ what this woman gave you, and that I am very happy that it light in the hands of a perſon of merit, as you are, although I doe not know you to be of the quality of him to whom I had intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my letter ſhould have been given, who is a brave Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon I tooke occaſion to tell her what I was, but feigned to be come to the Court for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſions then thoſe that kept me there. She anſwered me, that the courteous actions I had ſhewn her, would ſerve for warrant to my words, but that her affaire was a ſecret, praying me to pardon her if ſhe told me nothing thereof; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe judged I might be confided in for things of much greater importance, ſo it was continued, ſhe that the little knowledge which ſhe had of me, hindred her ftom taking the boldnes of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But for to render this diſcourſe leſſe troubleſome unto you, I muſt here make a digreſſion. You muſt know then, that during this time, I met <hi>Don Alonſo,</hi> whom I believed to have been far from <hi>Madrid;</hi> after embracements, and ordinary complements, which paſſe amongſt friends, he told me, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his paſſed ſorrowes he had a new diſpleaſure at his heart; this inquietude made me curious to know the cauſe thereof; then in renewing unto mee his ancient proteſtations of amity, he told me that the day before he was amongſt young men, ſuch as ſeek their paſtime every where, and who give to their ſenſes all they can wiſh for, who having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered where <hi>Eufemie</hi> was, and knowing that he had heretofore had deſign for her, had let him ſee her unknown to her, he being diſguiſed for that cauſe: that he had like to have died at the inſtant of this Viſion, and in this cruell diſpleaſure it was ſome eaſe to him to advertiſe me thereof, to ſeek mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to remedy it the moſt diſcreetly that could be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>Theſe newes ſtirred up ſo violently my vengeance, that nothing ſeemed hard to me to execute; hee named to me the ſtreet and houſe, and then left me: Almoſt at the ſame time, a ſervant that was unknown to me, came to tell me that there was a Lady in ſuch a houſe that deſired to ſee me in the evening, and communicate unto me ſomething of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54530:38"/>importance, and preſently went her way; the houſe which ſhe directed me unto was the very ſame that <hi>Alonſo</hi> had told me of, where reſided the originall of my opprobry. I conſidered the great impudence of her that deſired to ſee me in ſtead of flying from me, which made me ſuſpect ſome treaſon; but amongſt theſe confuſions, paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all apprehenſions, I went to the lodging with a ponyard hidden. This new Meſſenger ſtayed for me at the doore, and conducted me into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where I found a candle upon a cup-board a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, after a long ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of minde, the apprehenſions of hate gave place to thoſe of love; and as I went to demand her pardon for my errour, there came into the chamber the ſervant that came to ſeeke me from her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ccompanied with <hi>Feliciane,</hi> her firſt confident, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54530:39"/>that I would take away the life of her, that had raviſhed from me my liberty; and ſeeing me yet have the ponyard in my hand, which gliſſened by the light of the candle, they fled, crying murder, and for help. I went after them, to ſtay them, and upon the ſtaires I met laſcivious <hi>Eufemie,</hi> coming up with a torch in her hand, to know from whence proceeded this great diſorder. For me, I confeſſe, that when I knew her, my whole body begun to tremble, being ready to diſcharge it ſelf of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden of my affront; but as ſoone as ſhe ſaw me with the ponyard in my hand, feare of death ſo violently tranſported her, that ſhe caſt her ſelfe out of a window of the ſtaires which looked into the Court, I was very glad to ſee her reſolution, thinking that in ſaving her ſelfe from my rigour, ſhe would chaſtiſe her ſelfe, but it happened other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: I put my head out of the window, thinking to have ſeen her broken to pieces upon the pavement, and I ſaw her in the armes of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> he who had debauched her, who happened to be directly under the window at the inſtant of her fall, he ſaved her in receiving her into his armes, for he was ſtrong, and the window not very high. I ran haſtily to take the occaſion that was offered me to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of them both in the ſame time, and ponyard them both together, but the two ſervants had ſhut the doore of the ſtairs which entred into the court. Seeing then ſo many obſtacles to the execution of my deſign, choler ſo violently ſurmounted me, that I went up the ſtaires to caſt my ſelfe out of the ſame window, I did it as ſoone as thought it, but my fall was not ſo happy as that of <hi>Eufemie,</hi> I hurt ſo
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54530:39"/>extreamely one of my legges, that when J would have gone to have ruined my enemies, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to goe, which gave them leiſure to ſave themſelves. <hi>Teodore</hi> altogether confuſed with this prodigious rumour, got quickly to her lodging, wherein ſhe entered without wakening her father. J doubt not Gentlemen, but that you deſire to know by what accident <hi>Teoddre</hi> came into this place, but J will tell you the reaſon thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eufemy</hi> was lodged neare her houſe, and <hi>Teodore</hi> knowing the life which ſhe led, determined to be acquainted with her, by the intermiſſion of <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciane,</hi> who went to make complements to her from her in the quality of a neighbour. At the end of ſome few dayes, ſhe demanded permiſſion of her Father (for her Mother was deceaſed) to goe ſee one of her coſens that was ſick. The good man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his daughter excited with ſo charitable a deſire, gave her leave, upon condition, that <hi>Feliciane</hi> ſhould accompany her; for he confided in her, and thought the Chaſtity of <hi>Teodore</hi> in great ſafeguard with her.</p>
                  <p>They went abroad together, made ſome turnes in the ſtreets, and ſtayed under a doore, where they diſguiſed themſelves, as well as they could; for feare of being known, and ſo entered into the houſe of <hi>Eufemie.</hi> She ſeeing <hi>Teodore</hi> at her houſe was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with that honour, as they are ordinarily who meddle with the trade ſhe did, when other women come to viſite them. <hi>Eufemy</hi> imbraced her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, tranſported with joy and admiration; and after many faire words given and received of one and the other, <hi>Eufemie</hi> prayed <hi>Teodore</hi> to tell her
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54530:40"/>wherefore ſhe had taken the pains to viſit her. Then without ſuffering her ſelfe to be much entreated, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngeniouſly declared to her that ſhe had made choice of her lodging to ſatisfie an extreame paſſion; that ſhe loved a Cavalier, which ſhee was a going to ſend for; and for that purpoſe, ſhe prayed her to lend her a chamber for a little time, that paſſing for a Courtizan, ſhe might without being known, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her amorous deſires.</p>
                  <p>Conſider a little how this Gentlewoman proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her honour, to adhere to her ſenſual fantaſies! but what is it that a woman animated with love wil not prove to make eaſie the things that ſeem to her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible? let us now return to the houſe of <hi>Eufemie,</hi> to ſee what happened there, after the hurt which I had received in leaping out of the window. Her ſervant which fled away, ſeeing mee with the Ponyard in my hand, went in a fright to fetch a Juſtice, who being arrived, made me be carryed to priſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any formalitie in a chaire. Before that this offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer was entered into the houſe, the Pregnotory had received the depoſitions of two witneſſes, who ſaid that I had given to a woman three great ſtabs with a Ponyard, and that they had ſeen the wounds. The vulgar are ſuch lyars, that they affirme to have ſeen that they onely dream'd of, and hold for truth what they have heard ſay, as if they had ſeen it. They would then know in what eſtate the hurt perſon was, but they found nothing but witneſſes of my juſtification; nevertheleſſe I remained three weekes a priſoner. Doe but ſee a little how rigorouſly the innocents are handled by thoſe people they call Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54530:40"/>
                  <p>In the mean while <hi>Eufemie</hi> &amp; her protector chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged either the country or quarter, but if they were in <hi>Madrid,</hi> they were well hid; for in ſix moneths that I ſtayed there, it was impoſſible for me to hear news of them, what diligence ſoever I could uſe. As long as my captivity laſted, <hi>Teodore</hi> ſent often <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi> to ſee me, and to offer me aſſiſtance and mony, but not having need, neither of the one nor other, both becauſe of my juſtification, and not being in want; I thanked her, remaining alwaies extreamly obliged to her good will, and indebted to her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereof ſhe rendered me ſufficient proofes during my impriſonment. If my body was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertv, my ſoule was enchained; the beauty of <hi>Teodore</hi> captivated all my powers; my underſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood nothing but of her, my memory had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther image, my will walked not but by the ſhadow of hers: She ſimpathized to all my feelings; I fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to be every night at the foote of her walls, and ſhe never wanted to be at her window: I lived not but by her preſence, nor her heart was ever at eaſe but when ſhe ſaw me. One night when I went to prattle with her, and give nouriſhment to my flames, her father ſurpriſed her, which was the cauſe that the window was walled up, and that this Sun was long time eclipſed from me. After having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much for her abſence, I had a Packet brought to me from the Poſte, wherein was a Letter directed to the Father of <hi>Teodore.</hi> I preſently imagined that this was not done without myſtery; in this thought I opened the Letter, which was directed to mee, wherein I found this diſcourſe, which I knew to be written by the hand of <hi>Teodore.</hi>

                        <p>I have already rendered you ſo many proofes of my affection, deere <hi>Leonard,</hi> that I doe not thinke you can doubt thereof: If you deſire to conſerve it, you muſt aſſiſt me to warrant it from the dangers that threaten it, or I ſhall now know that yours is but diſſimulation. My father treateth about marrying me to a Cavalier his kinſman, who is of the province of <hi>Guipuſcoa</hi> as he himſelfe is, and although there are preſented many parties more advantagious for me, yet thoſe of that country are of ſuch humor; that they eſteeme none but thoſe of their owne nation; for that cauſe my father deſires I ſhould continue the alliance thereof: but my nature repugnes to thoſe affections, becauſe your merit makes me ſearch meanes to avoid the conſtraint of this obedience. He expects hourely this Cavalier, and I prepare my ſelfe for death every moment. I am told that hee hath beene ruſtically educated; and to marry me to him was to renew the cruell tortures of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, it is to tye a living perſon to a dead, to make it die with more horrour. Succour me in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I run, ſince it is onely your conſideration that that renders all propoſitions of marriage odious unto me. It will be eaſie for you to doe in taking a country habit, and faining your ſelfe to be called <hi>Don Martin Elizalde,</hi> and give this packet of letters to my father: this being done to ſave me, I will charge my ſelfe with the reſt.</p>

                  <p>I was a little ſhaken in the reſolution of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54530:41"/>but ſeeing that therin conſiſted the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a thing ſo pretious, as was the love of. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore,</hi> I clothed my ſelfe like a traveller, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a Mule; I arrived all alone at the dore of my deere <hi>Teodore:</hi> I addreſſed my ſelfe to her father, gave him her letter, fained to be <hi>Don Martin,</hi> and ſaying that I was advanced two dayes journeys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my people and equipage, to ſatisfie the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous impatience that I had to ſee his daughter. I was imbraced by him with much affection. All the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily received me with applauſe; <hi>Theodore</hi> felt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior joy, but ſhe made appeare an exteriour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie. I ſpoke little for feare of diſcovering my ſelfe: I was reſpectfull as a young lover and ſtranger. The letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which <hi>Teodore</hi> had ſent were read, the which were effectually come from <hi>Guipuſcoa,</hi> and light in her hands unknowne to her father; ſo that ſhe had kept them to ſerve her ſelfe thereof upon occaſion. I am aſtoniſhed ſaid her father to me, that my coſen your father ſends me word, that <hi>Don Martin</hi> ſhould begin his journey within a ſhort time, and nevertheleſſe you are already arrived: I was already extreamely ſurprized with theſe words, but love inſpired me ſuddainely with this reply. Sir ſaid I, it is true that my father believed that I ſhould not come ſo ſoone as I am, and to give you ſome excuſe for my delay, he writ this letter, but my affection which could not permit any ſtay, ſolicited me to be the bearer thereof my ſelfe. Hee eaſily beleeved me, and two dayes after with the diſpenſation of the popes <hi>Nuntio Teodore</hi> and I were married without publication of banes. The day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing I ſo admired at this ſucceſſe that I knew
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54530:42"/>not my ſelfe, I looked in the
glaſſe fearing that I was ſome other. In truth I was ſo, for a wiſe man ceaſeth to be himſelfe when he marrieth. I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated my wife, who I ſaw raviſhed to have me for her huſband; and in this conformitie of joy it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med impoſſible that any humane contentment could equall my amorous impriſonment and her free poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the very exceſſe of this joy I was in great care of what would be the ſucceſſe of this intricacy. We expected from houre to houre <hi>Don Martin;</hi> at the beginning of the night one of his Laquyes arrived, ſaying that he would come the next day, and that he was got before to deſerve the recompence of bringing the firſt newes thereof; when the good man my father in law heard that <hi>Don Martin</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he came up all moved into the chamber where I was ſet neere to <hi>Teodore,</hi> and asked me where I le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> my traine. Then in ſmiling I puſhed his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with my elbow to the end ſhe might anſwer for me to this queſtion. She boldly told him that I was not <hi>Don Martin,</hi> but a cavalier of <hi>Valence,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled him in nobleneſſe, and ſurpaſſed him in riches, that ſhe was aſſured of all this before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved her ſelfe to doe what ſhe had done; and if that I wanted thoſe advantages my merits and her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would ſupply all. In fine, that ſince I was her huband there was nothing more to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>She ſpoke with the reſolution of a wife that would pleaſe her husband: her father, who loved her dearely, anſwered her, that if ſhe was content, he was ſo alſo: that he eſteemed and honoured my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but that he feared that <hi>Don Martin</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54530:42"/>offended with this proceeding ſhould doe them ſome diſpleaſure. <hi>Teodore</hi> anſwered him, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he ſhould let her alone, and ſhe would remedy all, or would be expoſed to ſuffer a lone all the evill that could come thereof.</p>
                  <p>In this occaſion, I found that a womans ſpirit is extreamly ingenious in preſſing affaires. Her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, to counſell me to goe out of the houſe, and to court her as if I was her lover, and not her husband; then ſhe prayed her father, and advertiſed all the ſervants, who would have ſacrificed their lives to ſerve her, to make a joyfull reception of the ſtranger when he ſhould come, even as he was to be her husband. The aſſurance that I had of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her wit, and ſeeing that I neither hazarded her honour nor mine owne in executing her adviſe, obliged me to ayde and conſent to her deſignes. I went out of the houſe the ſame day that this abuſed cavalier arrived. He was receiued with all the good cheare that was poſſible, but he appeared to the eyes and judgments of all thoſe of the houſe, a beaſt in humane forme, with an ill countenance, uncivill and unweildy, ſo that his impertinence rendered me the more commendable; which gave greater meanes to <hi>Teodore</hi> to conduct her project as ſhee had premeditated. From that day I went and came many times before the houſe: he tooke notice of theſe actions, and ſaw that I lifted up mine eyes every moment to the windowes where <hi>Feliciane</hi> appeared every moment; and he imagining that we did not perceive that he ſpyed our actions, he perceived that I gave a letter to the ſame <hi>Feliciane,</hi> which ſhe put in her boſome, and as being unſeene gave it to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54530:43"/>
                     <hi>Teodore.</hi> In briefe, every one of us played ſo well his perſonage in this Comedy, where <hi>Don Martin</hi> held the bable, that the cataſtrophe thereof was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant for us, and ridiculous for him. Seeing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witneſſes, that his Miſtreſſe had other thoughts then his, he begun to ſeeme melancholick; he ſpoke but by monoſyllables; he neither eat nor ſlept, but to the halfe part: in fine, to deliver himſelf from theſe inquietudes, he preſſed the concluſion of the Marriage; but of the other ſide, <hi>Teodore</hi> prayed her Father in his preſence to deferre it yet, excuſing her ſelfe to be indiſpoſed to that action; and he, full of reſpect, or rather feare, reſolved to have patience and ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>In the interim, to the end to make him the more ſick, it came into my fancie to give a ſerenade to my wife, counterfeiting the amorous paſſionate, and having advertiſed her at what houre I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her window, ſhe came to the window, where ſhe heard theſe verſes recited.</p>

                  <p>In ſuch occaſions, the greateſt part of diſcreet Lovers, content themſelves that the ſubject of their paſſion know, that it is they that give the Muſick, and endeavour to hide the knowledge thereof from all others, but I proceeded otherwiſe: When the Conſort was ended, I approached to thoſe that had ſung, and ſpeaking high, made my ſelfe to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with deſign to be knowne; from thence I went to ſalute <hi>Teodore,</hi> and after having made her excuſes, that the Verſe and Muſick were not ſo good as ſhe deſerved, and ſhe had given me ſuch thanks as civility obliged her to, I retired my ſelf, teſtifying by my geſtures and words, that I was much in her favour.</p>
                  <p>This jolly troop that accompanied me were not ſo modeſt, nor made ſo little noiſe before the houſe of <hi>Teodore,</hi> but that they wakened my poore compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor, or rather gave him ſubject to riſe from his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54530:44"/>bed; for I thinke his inquietudes would not ſuffer him to ſleep. He came then to heare this conſort, which was as odious to him, as pleaſant to others that heard it, yet he ſpoke not one word thereof, no more than of the words he had heard, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelfe to confer with one of his ſervants, whom he had made his confident; who having more wit and underſtanding, let him know, that <hi>Teodore</hi> muſt needs be engaged in affection to him that gave her the Serenade; that ſuch carriages were to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, he adviſed him to retire himſelf, if he would ſave his honour. <hi>Don Martin</hi> being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe reaſons, faigned to have received a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from his Father, which called him home in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, becauſe he was very ſick, and taking leave of the father of <hi>Teodore,</hi> promiſed him to returne as ſoon as he could poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Teodore</hi> quit her ſelf ingeniouſly of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing pretendant; we re-entered into the enjoying of our felicitie (one may ſo call a marriage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the affections are conformable) The invention was publiſhed, and the ignorance of the <hi>Biſcain</hi> Gentleman mocked.</p>
                  <p>But as there is no pleaſure in this life which is not mingled with bitternes, not long after his departure my Father in Law took alſo leave of us for to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better life.

J pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared my ſelfe to meet him, not with deſigne to doe him any diſpleaſure, but civilly to ſatisfie him, when a man came as a friend to admoniſh me not to ſtirre out but well armed, and with a good ſecond, becauſe the Letter that I had received came not from <hi>Don Martin,</hi> but from two of the Coſens of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> in his name, who would ſet upon me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their Kinſman, (whom they were told) I had killed. J was not ſo raſh to deſpiſe this advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: J furniſhed my ſelf with what was requiſite to reſiſt mine enemy, and accompanyed my ſelfe with <hi>Seigneur Marcell</hi> my Kinſman, a generous man, and to whom J am obliged. We came together to the rendezvous, which was neare to the place where J ſet upon you, where J knew your valour, and where J hurt my heart with a perpetuall ſorrow in hurting you; for reparation of which fault, and to convert our indifferences into affection, J con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate to eaſe your troubles and misfortunes my houſe, my perſon and all J poſſeſſe.</p>

He aroſe quickly and ſaw a young maide of the houſe, who with an action, fearefull and haſty, ſayd to him. Sir, I doubt not but you are aſtoniſhed, to ſee me here, for admiration is the daughter of Novelty: here is a letter from <hi>Celie</hi> my miſtreſſe which ſhee prayeth you to reade, and ſatisfie her in what ſhe deſires of you, if the reſpect of an honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may oblige you thereunto. <hi>Feniſe</hi> demanded of her who <hi>Celie</hi> was: the meſſenger anſwered him
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54530:46"/>that ſhee was the ſiſter of <hi>Leonard,</hi> and that ſhe could not talke to him any longer for feare the Cavalier ſhould finde her ſpeaking to him , or might have ſome ſhadow thereof. <hi>Feniſe</hi> more aſtoniſhed then before, received the letter, made a complement to the meſſenger and her miſtriſſe, and promiſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey all that ſhe could command him, aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that their diſcretion, would not engage him in uncivill enterpriſes. This maide being gone, <hi>Feni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe</hi> was ill troubled to imagine what this Lady could deſire from him, having never ſeene him; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe after having many times contemplated the letter yet ſealed, he reſolved to open it, and ſaw that it conteyned this diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>Never man was ſo ſurpriſed as <hi>Feniſe</hi> was after the reading of this writing; he read it three or foure times over, and the more he read it the more aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas he found therein. He had divers imaginations, but that which troubled him the moſt, was the feare to be invited to ſome action, which might violate the reſpect of hoſpitality which he reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as things holy. In the end reſolved to enterpriſe nothing unworthy of him, he went out of the houſe at the houre appointed, and walked thereabouts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the maid that was to be his guide. She came incontinent, her face covered with a vaile; ſhe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Feniſe</hi> and asked him his name; and ſeeing that it was he whom ſhe ſought, ſhe prayed him to follow her, but a little behind for feare of being perceived, and that he ſhould enter boldly and without any apprehenſion, into the houſe whither ſhee carryed him. <hi>Feniſe</hi> anſwered her that he feared nothing, having nothing to loſe but his life, and he needed not ſearch far, to be too unhappy. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus he went after the maide, and not far from the place where they met, they ſecretly entered into a houſe, very faire without and curiouſly hung within; at the entry into the hall, this girle diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her face, and bad him yet follow her; ſhe led him up a paire; of ſtayres into an Anti-chamber, richly adorned with the faireſt tapeſtry of <hi>Flanders:</hi> then his conductreſſe prayed him to ſtay a little, to whom he obeyed; in the interim he conſidered the proprietie of this houſe, and to what end he was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54530:47"/>brought thither: but incontinently the maide retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made him enter into a great cabinet, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with an infinite of rich furniture, as pictures, glaſſes, plate, candleſticks, and armes of ſilver gilt, and other curioſities very delightfull to the ſight, a great piece of Turky tapiſtrie covered the floore, upon the which were great ſtore of cuſhions, and cuſhionets, of velvet, and imbroydery. When he was there, there entred a young Lady, perfectly faire, cloathed in mourning, but with ſuch order, comelineſſe, and good carriage, that with this modeſt and ſad colour, ſhe had more Majeſty and Luſtre, then another would have had in the moſt lively colours and ſhining attires. Having ſaluted one the other, ſhe made them give him a ſeat, ſat herſelfe down by him, and commanded her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to retire themſelves to the end ſhe might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more freely of her ſecrets.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſpoke, and by a well poliſhed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement let her know his ability in ſpeaking, and the vivacity of his wit: This Lady anſwered him with all the courteſie and civility imaginable. Sir (ſaid ſhe) I thanke my good fortune, for having rendred me ſo happy as to have your acquaintance, to truſt you with an important affaire, wherein I have need of two excellent qualities, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to finde in your perſon, diſcretion, and valour; the one for to keep ſecret the project, and the other for to execute it. And ſince that you offer me your aſſiſtance in this occaſion, I will take you at your word, upon the aſſurance that I have, that you have too much generoſity to faile in the effects of your words. But before that I explicate my ſelfe further,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54530:48"/>it is neceſſary that I make you a little diſcourſe of my life, to move you the more to aſſiſt me in the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which oppreſſe me.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORIE OF <hi>RUFINE</hi> AND <hi>DON IOUAN.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALthough that my Parents are not much accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with the favours of Fortune, ſo it is that Nature gratified them with an honour which cannnot be purchaſed with riches, which is noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. With this advantage I was borne in <hi>Seville,</hi> one of the moſt pleaſant Towns the Sun ſhineth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I am called <hi>Rufine:</hi> My Father and Mother ſeeing that Heaven had not made me ill-favoured, if I may ſpeake it without vanity, had care to bring me up according as their little eſtate would permit. I had attained to the ſixteenth year of my age, when a Cavalier of this Town of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alence,</hi> of an illuſtrious name, coming from <hi>Lema,</hi> a Towne and Realme of the Weſt Indies, took Port at <hi>Sevill,</hi> full of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and honour, and my deſtiny having one night conducted me into the company of Ladyes where he was invited, ſhe alſo made him caſt his eyes upon me, and made me the object of his deſires. After which time, to abridge my diſcourſe, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into his free poſſeſſion, but by the holy waies of Chriſtian Lawes. Not long after he had deſigne to returne into his Countrey, and to take me with him, there to eſtabliſh our perpetuall abode; and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54530:48"/>foraſmuch an honeſt wife ought to have no other will but that of her husband, I willingly went with him, and we lived together ſix years, which was the time that Heaven had limited to finiſh my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with his life. I then remained alone, yet accompanied with riches and ſorrow, for temporall goods are not alwayes the riches of the ſoule, from whence it proceeds that there is many poor conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and rich miſerable. He left me the only inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritrix of all his poſſeſſions, by which means I was reſpected and ſerved as a Queen. My ſorrowes for the loſſe of this brave Cavalier kept me company two years entire; but in the end, ſuffering my ſelfe to be perſwaded by the conſolations of my friends that viſited me, I begun to leave my ſolitude, and to frequent thoſe converſations whither my youth led me. In one of theſe Aſſemblies I was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Gentleman, a ſtranger which arrived in this Towne about three moneths ſince, a man of a good countenance, and as well accompliſhed as any other of his condition, ſuffering himſelfe to be wounded by mine eyes (as he ſaid) he found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to declare his inquietudes by a Letter, which I favourably received, and found it ſo well indicted, that it incited me to eſteem the Author, and give him a civill anſwer, from whence he took occaſion to render me proofes of a ſincere paſſion, and the ſervices of a voluntary ſlave. In the end, his continuall ſubmiſſions obliged me to wiſh him well, and for to render him ſome proofes thereof, I permitted him to viſit me one evening after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but my Garden-window was betwixt us. In the enjoying of this honour, after having told
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54530:49"/>me that he was of <hi>Teledo,</hi> and was called <hi>Don Jou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an de Valazquez,</hi> he made me a thouſand proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſervice, ſwearing to renounce all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances to remaine all his life at my feet if it pleaſed me, and eſteeming himſelfe moſt happy to he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſubjection of ſo adorable a Miſtreſſe; theſe was the termes which he uſed. But ſeeing that his paſſion begun to enter into exceſſe, I prayed him to retire himſelf, ſhewing him that this was enough for the firſt ſight; aſſuring him that I honoured him with all my heart. He obeyed me, and at the ſame time went his way, and left me as voluntarily obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for after a woman of honour hath given her word, ſhe is bound to accompliſh it.</p>
                  <p>He ſaw me many other times in the ſame manner, and one night, knowing that I would not agree that he ſhould come into my houſe, nor adhere to his deſires, if he did not give me his word to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me, he made me promiſe thereof, in taking my hand and kiſſing it, believing already, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this weak aſſurance, I muſt accord to what he pretended, and by and by open him the doore of my houſe and honour; but he ſaw himſelfe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his attempt. Having received his proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I made him anſwer, that ſince we were both of free condition, and that there was nothing that could croſſe our mutuall intentions, the next day we would diſpoſe our ſelves to confirme our faith in the preſence of the ſacred Miniſters, and after that, he ſhould have an abſolute power over my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, goods, and life.</p>
                  <p>When he ſaw me in this reſolution, he begun to demand term for the execution thereof, ſaying that

I found this woman ſo willing to ſatisfie me, that ſhe told me more then f expected. She told me that <hi>Don Jouan</hi> had with him an extream faire Lady, which was of his Country, and who was called <hi>Laure.</hi> That at firſt when he brought her to <hi>Valence,</hi> he could not make her reſolve to adhere to his deſires, but at the preſent ſhe believed ſhe was pacified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his will.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, What is it that the malitious induſtry of men will not accompliſh? And to what fragilitie is not the inconſtant nature of a woman ſubject? I thought it ſtrange that this Lady ſhould ſhew her ſelfe ſo cruell towards him, ſince that ſhe came with him, and when I demanded of this woman the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54530:50"/>cauſe thereof, ſhe told me, that ſhe had learned all of a ſervant of <hi>Don Iovans</hi> (with whom I hear ſince ſhe hath good intelligence) who told her, that <hi>Don Iovan</hi> was become amorous at <hi>Toledo</hi> of a Lady, Miſtreſſe to one of his friends: That having been forced to abſent himſelfe for a Homicide which he had committed, and not being able to carry her with him, he had left this ſervant at <hi>Toledo,</hi> to ſee what would become of this Lady during his abſence, and to let him know when it would be expedient to execute the intention which he had to ſteale her ſecretly, and to carry her away with him; ſo that this ſervant faithfull to his Maſter, having diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this Lady was in the company of her true Lover, who was conducting her to <hi>Valence,</hi> he had followed them from place to place diſguiſed, and had got before them the laſt dayes journey with diligence, to advertiſe his Maſter thereof, who at the ſame inſtant accompanyed with him and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his friends diſguiſed, and put themſelves in ambuſh in the way, and with more treaſon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry than valour, had ſurpriſed theſe Lovers, and ſtolne away the Lady, whom hee keeps at this houre in his houſe. In fine, by force of flatteries, ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by diverting her by all the recreations he could deviſe, he had not onely made her forget her liſpleaſures, but had rendered her ſenſible of his paſſion.</p>
                  <p>After this diſcourſe, I remained in the condition of a jealous perſon, who hath found the cauſe of his diſeaſe, proteſting to ſearch all meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my ſelfe. It is long ſince I have been troubled for this purpoſe; for although this paſſion be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54530:50"/>amongſt women, and in me more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet I would not make my infirmity pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely knowne; I deſire to redreſſe it. And communicating my feelings yeſterday to Madam <hi>Celie,</hi> mine aliant, if amitie contracts aliance, ſhe told me of the merits of your perſon, and amongſt others, your courage and diſcretion; ſo that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all theſe circumſtances, and alſo that you are a ſtranger in this towne, and of the countrey of <hi>Don Jovan,</hi> I determined with the counſel of <hi>Celie,</hi> to to diſcover to you the evill which perſecutes me, to truſt to you with my ſecrets, and to demand your aſſiſtance to put my ſpirit to repoſe. I doe not hope it from any merit of mine own, but from your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per valour, which will not ſuffer you to refuſe a curteſie to a Lady which never will be ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>It was not neceſſary to give ſo many markes to <hi>Feniſe,</hi> to let him know that the authour of this affront had been before truſted with the ſecreets of his Loves. But in diſſembling his anger and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, he buſied himſelfe in thinking what art hee ſhould uſe to revenge himſelfe of this perfidious, being thereunto engaged more by his proper fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, than by the intereſts or prayers of <hi>Rufine.</hi> Madam, anſwered he, you have ſhewne ſo much wit and judgement in the diſcourſe you have now told me, that in truſting me with your ſecrets you have raviſhed from me my liberty. I can no longer diſpoſe of my will, I am ready to obey all you pleaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; aſſuring you that I will be the inſtrument of your vengeance, and the executer of your deſires. I finde ſo much cowardlineſſe and infamy in the ſoul
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54530:51"/>of <hi>Don Iovan,</hi> that although he bee of noble extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I eſteeme him no more than an infamous perſon. It is not the ſame thing to be born noble, and to be ſo, for there are many that are noble, without being borne ſo; and alſo many that dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from their nobleneſſe by the unworthy actions which they commit. Sir, replyed <hi>Rufine,</hi> I eſteeme my ſelfe no longer unhappy, ſince that Heaven hath now given me ſo generous a defendor as you are.</p>
                  <p>But to beginne our enterpriſe, t deſire that you ſhould this night know the houſe and perſon. I have already made one of my Coſens become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Laure,</hi> ſhe ſhall anone goe to viſit her, and you with her, if you pleaſe, diſguiſed, and in the quality of her ſervant to waite upon her. The evill that I deſire to doe to this ingrate, by your meanes is no other then what he hath already done to the Cavalier from whom he hath raviſhed <hi>Laure</hi> his honour, and joy all together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> was then in humour to undertake any thing, nothing ſeemed difficult unto him: And remembering himſelfe of the recitall which <hi>Rufine</hi> had made him, he judged that he was one of the three with his face covered, that had left him for dead in the mountaines of <hi>Toledo,</hi> as we have told you in the beginning of this booke. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this opinion by that (which <hi>Laure</hi> had told him) he had done the night he had ſlain <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> which was to goe to her chamber under pretext to warrant her from the danger of Juſtice; and all this was but adding oyle to the fire of his choler. In fine, the time that <hi>Rufine</hi> and he deſired with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54530:51"/>arrived: <hi>Narciſſe</hi> which was her Coſen came at the houre ſhe was ſent for, and going out with <hi>Feniſe</hi> came incontinently to the houſe of <hi>Don Iovan. Feniſe</hi> let <hi>Narciſſe</hi> goe in, and attended at the doore diſguiſed with a falſe beard, faigning to bee ſervant to this Gentlewoman, who was courteouſly received by <hi>Laure,</hi> and welcomed by <hi>Don Iovan;</hi> if not as the coſen of <hi>Rufine,</hi> at the leaſt in the quality of the intimate friend of <hi>Laure. Feniſe</hi> was not ſo farre from the roome where they converſed, but that he heard all that they did and ſayd, in walking; for the doore was open. He knew his perfidious friend and ingratefull Lover, whoſe repoſe of ſpirit he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, whilſt his ſuffered ſo great inquietudes. He repreſented to himſelfe a thouſand things, whoſe concluſions were alwaies augmentations to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures. Many times he was upon the very point to execute his vengeance, ſo farre did his anger tranſport him; then he deferred it, expecting a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion.</p>
                  <p>He forgot himſelfe to remarke their diſbourſes, familiaritie and love; he almoſt loſt his wits in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtrange change of <hi>Laure.</hi> At every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſaw geſtures, or heard ſuch diſcourſes as made him die with deſpite, and yet he beheld and hearkened carefully. So the greateſt evill of jealous perſons (and what hinders them from finding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie) is to deſire things which kill them. Every minute ſeemed to him an age, but as ages have their beginnings, they have their ends. <hi>Narciſse</hi> at the end of a little time took leave, &amp; went out of the room. <hi>Laure</hi> went out with her to accompany her, where <hi>Feniſe</hi> had accaſion to conſider her as well with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54530:52"/>ſorrow to ſee her ſo ingratefull, as to ſee her ſo diſhoneſty abandoned, to the poſſeſſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he could not ſpeake; and had it not beene for feare of giving advantage to his enemies he had at that time committed ſome exceſſe. <hi>Don Jouan</hi> would waite upon <hi>Narciſſe</hi> to her houſe, although ſhe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not to take that paines, ſhe having a man with her for that purpoſe, but the courteſie of the Cavalier prevailed with her. When <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſaw ſo neer to him the author of his troubles, he had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon his life, had it not beene for the reſpect he bore to <hi>Narciſſe;</hi> But <hi>Don Jouan</hi> having left her at one of her friends houſes where ſhe fained to have buſineſſe, <hi>Feniſe</hi> followed him, and not far from thence, overtooke him with his falſe beard which diſguiſed his voice as well as his face, for he held it in his teeth by a little ſtringe of wyer; Sir, ſaid he, faining not to know him, is it not you who is called <hi>Don Jouan?</hi> yes anſwered the traytor, what would you have with me? there is, anſwered <hi>Feniſe,</hi> a Lady without the gate of the towne in a Coach who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to communicate to you a ſecret of importance, if you will ſee her: Who is ſhe, ſaid <hi>Don Jouan;</hi> I dare not tell you her name, anſwered <hi>Feniſe,</hi> not being aſſured that you will take the paines to goe to her: but you need feare nothing, you ſhall ſpeake to her alone. I wil goe upon your word, replyed <hi>Don Iouan,</hi> though it may be another would make difficultie thereof; ſaying thus, he lead him to a place a little diſtant from the towne, when <hi>Don Jouan</hi> looking on all ſides him, and ſeeing no body, whether he knew <hi>Feniſe</hi> or no, he asked him where the Lady was, you ſhall ſee her preſently anſwered <hi>Feniſe.</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:54530:52"/>Then <hi>Don Iouan</hi> drawing his ſword and retiring three paces, told him that before he paſſed further he would know who he was. I am content ſaid ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly our inraged lover caſting away his falſe beard, looke upon me, I am <hi>Feniſe,</hi> and know, that I have but thus long retarded to make thee feele the chaſtiſement of thy treaſon, to bring thee into a place where there may be no witneſſes of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance I am going to take of thy treachery, for I hope that heaven the revenger of wrongs will aſſiſt me in this action: in ſaying ſo he threw away the ſcabbard of his ſword and poinyard, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the poſture of an active and valiant man; <hi>Don Jouan</hi> knowing who he had before him, full of confuſion or ſhame, made him no ſatisfaction, but on the contrary told him, that he had long deſired this meeting, and that he was glad to ſee him in this eſtate, for to take his life from him generouſly; and by his death to enjoy more freely the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he poſſeſſed. He could ſay no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Feniſe</hi> preſſed him ſo quickly, or rather ſo mortally, that it behooved him to moove all his members, in ſtead of his tongue to defend himſelfe from the furious thruſts which he gave him, being newly angred with the inſolent words of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But what violence or addreſſe he could uſe in this action; he preſently felt the juſt puniſhment of his treachery: <hi>Feniſe</hi> gave him three wounds, by the which his ſoule found her deſired iſſue out of his traiterous body. His conquerour ſeeing him dead was ſorry for him, for ſo deplorable a death as that was, would touch the heart of any generous man. But adviſing himſelfe, that he ought more to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54530:53"/>the ſatisfaction of the offence then to pitty, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to doe as much to <hi>Laure,</hi> to the end to chaſtiſe her inconſtancy, exterminate her beauty, and to give a new example to ingratefulls; to this end he threw away his hat and cloake into a pit, and tooke thoſe of his enemy, which was of a higher colour, and being ſo covered, he went to the doore of the houſe of the dead man, where <hi>Laure</hi> was: he knocked, one of the ſervants looked out of a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia, and beleeving that it was <hi>Don Jouan</hi> her maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deſcended preſently to open him the doore, but not finding the key in the locke ſhe went up againe to looke it. Whilſt <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſtayed at the doore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting what he ſhould ſay and doe to his ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and perfidious <hi>Laure,</hi> when he heard a great brute of armes at the end of the ſtreete; which made him feare to be interrupted in his deſigne, if they came not preſently to open him the doore, becauſe theſe people being moved advanced towards him, it happened as he apprehended: the quarrellers kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the troope, who crying for confeſſion made all the reſt fly. Yet <hi>Feniſe</hi> had not ſtirred from the doore, alwaies hoping to enter, but either by the ſervants too great haſt to ſeek the key, or rather by the good fortune of <hi>Laure</hi> ſhe could not finde it. The clamours of this dying man neere the place where <hi>Feniſe</hi> was, brought thither incontinently the juſtice, which obliged him to abandon his place; for although he was innocent of this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he feared to be knowne the homicide of <hi>Don Jouan,</hi> whereof he bore witneſſes with him, which were his hat and cloake. He was ſo ſlow in retiring himſelfe that the juſtice perceived him when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

At this inſtant <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi> found himſelfe neere a gate of the towne which was yet open becauſe it was not ten a clocke. Then he reſolved for many reaſons to quitte <hi>Valence</hi> by the favour of the night, but as he begun to execute this determination, he heard that they begun to ring the bell; deſigned to advertiſe the officers of Juſtice of the company, that there was a malefactor eſcaped; which was the cuſtome of the country. To avoid being taken, he croſſed the country it may be becauſe he did not know the waies, and went about two leagues ſo tired that he was forced to yield to his wearineſſe and repoſe himſelfe, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the day. He ſat downe at the roote of a tree, his body being wearyed with travell and his ſpirit perplexed with a thouſand troubleſome thoughts. But he had ſcarcely begun to take breath, when in the mideſt of the ſilence of the night, he heard the echoes of the barking of dogs whoſe voices beat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Rock, whereby he knew that theſe dogges were a good way from him; which made him judg
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54530:54"/>that there was ſome houſe where he might retire himſelfe. He quitted his tree, went whither the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the dogges guided him, and arrived at the foot of a hill, upon the ſide whereof he ſaw a poore ſhepheards cabbin covered with bowes: he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and found no body there, but onely ſheep skin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which ſerved for a bed to the inhabitants. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame wearineſſe and ſleepineſſe which he had, obliged him to ſearch ſome place to repoſe in, and not finding any more commodious then thoſe skins, he lay downe upon them. The ſhepheards hoſts of this cabbin, advertiſed by the barking of their dogges, that there was ſome wolfe about their flocks, were gone out for to chaſe him, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their great haſt had forgotten to cover their fire: ſo that preſently after <hi>Feniſe</hi> was a ſleepe, he was awakened by the ſharpe ſtinke of a thicke ſmoake, which begun to choake him, the fire ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken hold of leavy fagotts. He ſought an iſſue to get out of this danger, and ſaw himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiged on one ſide with flames, and on the other bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoed with great pieces of wood: then he made reflection upon the eſtate he was in, and judged that this was to puniſh the offences he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and as he made this pious meditation, and aſſayed to make his way over theſe pieces of wood, the ſhepheards arrived at their little houſe, which they found all on fire, they preſently indeavoured to quench it. <hi>Feniſe</hi> having perceived them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored their ayd, crying withall his power: theſe poore ruſtiques were greatly aſtoniſhed to ſee a man ſo well clothed in the midle of ſo fearefull a danger, not knowing how he came thither. In the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54530:54"/>end imploying all their force and diligence, they got him miraculouſly out of this little hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much hurt, but not without much fear; for as theſe good people removed the wood to helpe him out, they let in aire which augmented the flames, wherewith the unfortunate Cavalier had like to have been devoured. Truly a man may bee eſteemed very unhappy, when thoſe that would procure his good doe him hurt, and that the eaſe they would give him turneth into the encreaſment of his paines. <hi>Feniſe</hi> having taken freſh aire, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his benefactors, and to give ſome ſatisfaction to their curioſity to know how he came into this danger, he invented an adventure, and told them that he was come from <hi>Barcelone</hi> to goe to <hi>Valence</hi> the lye was pardonable, ſince that in ſpeaking the truth his life was in danger; (for he feared he was followed) that being a quarter of a League from this Cabbin, wandring betwixt Dog and Wolfe, he met with Theeves that had diſmounted him, that being eſcaped from them he had loſt his way, and going he knew not whither, he had perceived their cabbin, and had retired himſelfe thither, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the day. Theſe ſimple perſons believed what he ſayd, and endeavoured to entertaine him the beſt they could: They killed a Kid, and made him eate with them, afterwards they dreſſed him a lodge with branches to keep him from the humidity of the night; and thus <hi>Feniſe</hi> expected the Sunnes returne.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as day appeared he would take leave of his hoſtes, and yet try the effects of his Fortune, forcing himſelfe to overcome her; for he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54530:55"/>rather to tire her with perſecuting him, then to make it knowne to her, that he wanted patience to ſuffer. He then renewed his thankes, and prayed them to ſhew him the way to <hi>Barcelone</hi> excuſing himſelfe that he was not able to ſtay longer with them, becauſe of important affaires which already ſuffered, by his delay and ill fortune, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to return the ſame way he came. Although they oppoſed his deſires with their prayers, they could not ſtay him any longer in this countrey place, for he knew well that a village life ought to be elected for ever, or avoyded as ſoon as could be, for feare of their taking of ſome impreſſion of malice, or clowniſh behaviour: Beſides, hoſts are maiſters of the houſe the firſt day, friends the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and enemies the third: In the beginning they bring joy, in the middle pains, and at the end trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>They ſent a Shepheard with him to ſet him in the way he deſired, and which he followed to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiedre:</hi> He there found a Traveller which came from <hi>Valence,</hi> of whom he demanded what newes there, who told him, that there was found out of the towne, a dead Cavalier, that the brute went that he had been ſlain by one of his friends, and that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices ſought after him by horſe and foot. This news made him change his courſe and draw towards <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragoce,</hi> alwaies going out of the highway, and in the night being favoured by the Moones brightnes, which was then towards the Full, about his third nights voyage, being cleare and bright, paſſing by the ſide of a Wood, he heard a plaintive voice, which endeavoured to oblige ſome one to moderate
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54530:55"/>his ſury. <hi>Feniſe</hi> judged by the delicateneſſe of the voice, that it was a vvoman, vvhich made him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to ſuccour her; as he came neare the place vvhere ſhe vvas, her complaints ceaſed, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tone of voice, more bold, he heard her ſpeake theſe vvords; Novv infamous thy bloud ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the affronts thou haſt done me. And at the ſame time, the voice of a man replyed; Ah trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe! I never expected leſſe from thy cruelty, and the vicious life I have led. Our Cavalier was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enter into the thick wood, where hee heard them ſpeake, but he was ſtayed by a man and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came from thence; ſhe proper and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly attired, he ſtrongly ſet, and of a valorous reſolution, who preſented to his head the mouth of a Piſtoll; ſtand ſaid he, returne from whence thou cameft, or thou dieſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſo ſurpriſed and threatned, would not hazard himſelfe, believing that there was nothing there that did concern him. He ſtayed, and ſaw theſe two without ſpeaking word take two Mules that were tied to a tree, mount upon them, and ride faſt away from the place where he was, and out of his ſight. His curioſitie and valour would not permit him to retire himſelf without looking what was become of him, who ſeemed by his ſad words to teſtifie his laſt ſorrowes: He entred by the ſame place the others came out of, and found a dead man upon the ground, wallowing in his bloud. He was conſidering this poore man, and diſcourſing upon the miſeries of this life, when he heard a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle noiſe of men which approached him, but he had not time to know what they were, for as ſoon
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54530:56"/>as they had perceived him, they fell upon him, bound his eyes, and called him traytor, homicide, and many other injurious names, and lead him tied and bound into a Village which was near that place. He endeavoured to juſtifie his innocence by reaſons, and to buy himſelf out of their hands by money; but whatſoever he could ſay or do, he could not moderate their violence. They put him load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with irons into a ſtinking dungeon, and there left him untill the next morning, abandoned to a thouſand ſad thoughts: The day being come, he that executed the office of Judge, but yet without judgment, came to interrogate him, and demand of him the confeſſion of the crime he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He asked him queſtions ſo impertinent, that he could ſcarcely anſwer to them, but in lifting up his eye-brows and ſhoulders. He knew nothing of what thay queſtioned him, and the Judge was perſwaded, that he vvho vvas purely ignorant, was maliciouſly vvilfull; ſo that he vvas ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him to death by the ſuffrage, as well of thoſe that helped to take him, as by the opinion of him that gave him advice thereof, when the Inne-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Village came to tell him that he believed that the priſoner he was about to condemn was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the crime he was accuſed of, and being asked upon what reaſons this opinion was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir, having ſeen you arrive at this place, and preſently conſidering your faſhion and actions, I believed that ſo many advantages of nature could not willingly meet in a common man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon imagining that you are a Gentleman, I have taken the boldneſſe to have recourſe to you, to endeavour to ſave my ſelf from the extream perill that threatens me.</p>
                  <p>Time, which preſſeth me, will not permit me here to recount the ſtrange misfortunes of my life, nor of what Country I am, it ſhall ſuffice me now to tell you that I am called <hi>Eufemie,</hi> and that a Cavalier who is here lodged with me, and now gone abroad, ſtole me from my houſe, under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Marriage. After having ſtayed ſome time with him, the ardour of his paſſion died, ſince which time he hath uſed me unworthily, and a thouſand times witneſſed an evill and unthankfull nature, contrary to the faith he had ſworne to me. I know not whither he carrieth me at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but the great love he bore me at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is changed into ſo cruell a hatred, that I doe but expect the houre when he ſhall take away my life, when he ſhall finde a place commodious for that purpoſe, as I may conjecture by his fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54530:57"/>threatnings, and his ſpeeches, which have been reported to me; ſo that fearing that his hatred and fury may tranſport him, I caſt my ſelf at your feet, humbly beſeeching you to take me into your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, ſince that it ſeems that Heaven hath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly brought you hither for this action of piety. This Lady ſpoke theſe words after ſo ſweet a manner, that they were able to move compaſſion in the moſt barbarous ſoule; for my part, I was ſenſibly touched therewith. As ſoon as ſhe had made known her intentions to this Cavalier, he promiſed to ſerve her in all things ſhe ſhould think him worthy; then they ſpoke ſoftly together; I believing it was becauſe I had ſtirred the latch of the doore in approaching to hearken, I retired my ſelf for feare of being ſurpriſed in ſo ill an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as to pry after the ſecrets of others, and ſhe came out preſently after to attend the returne of her dangerous conductor. As ſoon as he came in, I took notice of his behaviour, and ſaw that with a fierce look he told this young Lady that he would be gone before Sun-ſet, as he was. Scarcely were they out of my houſe, when the Gentleman to whom the Lady had ſpoken , and who had promiſed her aſſiſtance, followed them. And I fearing ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy accident, ſent one of my ſervants after them to know which way they went, to the end to give you notice thereof to follow their ſteps, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the evill that threatned ſo many people. This boy did as I had appointed him; but when he ſaw appearances ſo conformable to what I had heard, as he came to tell me what he had done, he met an Archer, to whom he told it. He going
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54530:57"/>to ſeek his companions to take them along with him, came too late, the murder was committed; ſo that they have brought to you this unhappy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, which I hold for innocent, for he was none of the company of thoſe that lodged at my houſe. I durſt not ſpeak of what I have now told you, for feare I might thereby get ſome diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but ſeeing the danger that threatneth a man whom I preſume not culpable, I had rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard my repoſe, then ſee him ſuffer without deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it. The Judge his Sonne came in upon this diſcourſe, who confirmed what the Inne-keeper had ſaid, aſſuring that he had newly met upon the way of <hi>tortoſa</hi> a man and a woman mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mules, with all the tokens and markes the Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper had ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>The Judge informed of theſe circumſtances, went to ſee the priſoner, whom he found leſſe ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then he left him, for delay made him hope the verity of his innocency would be diſcovered; he ſpoke to him with a countenance leſſe ſevere then before, exhorting him, not as Superiour, but friend, to declare to him how he came neare the dead corps in the wood, to the end he might help him to juſtifie himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe,</hi> who then ſaw the Judge more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then when he was brought before him, ſatisfied him with reaſons ſo accompanied with truth and likelyhood; that the Judge found them confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the relation of his Sonne, and the Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, he determined to ſet him at liberty; but how innocent ſoever he was found, he could not get out without leaving the bloud of his purſe.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54530:58"/>The talents of Pregnotories, Serjeants, and Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, are too ſharp, not to ſcratch a man, and it is a great grace when he eſcapes without being torn in pieces.</p>
                  <p>Our Cavalier ſeeing himſelf at liberty, reſolved to goe into Italy, and quit his Country <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſince that ſhe uſed him as a Step-mother, to try if in changing the Land, he ſhould not alſo change his fortune.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe he took the way to <hi>Barclone,</hi> where he arrived without any other diſgrace, but to ſuffer much by neceſſity upon the way, becauſe of the great charges he had been at to purchaſe his innocence. He could well have found friends in this great Town who would have ſupplyed his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, but he feared to be knowne; ſo that he choſe rather to ſuffer amongſt ſtrangers, then to be beholding to his Country-men. Then a Ship made ſaile towards that Country, he put himſelf in the ſervice of an Italian Lord, near whom his good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and wit had got him an acceſſe free enough. He imbarqued himſelf, and arrived happily at the Port of <hi>Gennes,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Naples,</hi> where was the abode and family of this Italian. This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier had found ſo great merit in <hi>Feniſe,</hi> that he loved paſſionately his converſation, one ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee him but with this Spaniard by his ſide, ſo that he did not treat him as a ſervant, but, as a friend. <hi>Ricard,</hi> ſo was this Lord called, had an urgent affaire, which obliged him to goe by night to ſeek the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> to conferre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with him, becauſe it was a buſineſſe of State. He took <hi>Feniſe</hi> with him to ſerve him for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54530:58"/>and ſafeguard. He entered into the lodgings of the Vice-Roy, and in the interim <hi>Feniſe</hi> walked in the great and ſpatious roomes of the pallace, in expecting his Maſter: And as curioſitie is the daughter of idleneſſe, <hi>Feniſe</hi> not knowing how to paſſe the time, was deſcended into the Court of the Caſtle, and approaching to a little doore, where he heard a noyſe of mens voices: hee liſtened, and knew incontinent that this was the lodging of the ſlaves of the Vice-Roy, Turkes and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, which ſpoke their naturall Language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that no body heard them, becauſe they judged that all was in bed, or that they knew not their langnage. But <hi>Feniſe</hi> who knew it perfectly well, having learned it of his fathers ſlave, as wee have ſayd, heard that they had conſpired againſt the life of the Vice-Roy, and the moſt reſolute of the Troope ſpoke thus to his companions. What my friends, ſhall we yet deferre the execution of our vengeance? Have we loſt our courages in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our liberty? Shall we be willing to die, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſelling our lives to thoſe that would have them? You know well the reſolution I have taken, to have reaſon of the Vice-Roy, whoſe people have killed my brother, and drowned my wife and ſhip, and for this effect, I have ſuffered my ſelfe to be made a captive to my enemies, to the end to finde that in Peace which I could not in Warre, by reaſon of my want of power; you know alſo how willingly you offered your ſelves to accompany me in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, without being forced thereunto by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This being, if I ſuffered my ſelfe to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alive; and you come with me for this intention,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54530:59"/>to what purpoſe ſerve ſo many delayes, but to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our cowardlyneſſe? For my part, I know I muſt dye, but I ſhall expire contented, in ſeeing my ſelfe ſatisfied? Courage then my dear friends, animate your juſt fury in exciting your cruelty; and ſince that our liberty is engaged for the end of this action, let us enterpriſe it boldly, if we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh therein, at the leaſt it will be with much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Then all the Troope renewed their oathes of fiderlitie, proteſting to enterpriſe valiantly all that he ſhould ordaine; and under this aſſurance he proceeded. I ſhall finde an invention, ſayd he, to hide my ſelfe to morrow in the Antichamber of the Vice-Roy, and you, when all ſhall bee in the greateſt ſilence, ſhall come and make a noiſe in the Hall, for to let me know when you are there. At the ſame inſtant you ſhall endeavour to amuſe the Guards, whilſt one of you open me the door with this double Key; for when I ſhall hear you, I will fall upon his perſon, and take away his life in a moment; then I will come to finde you, and we will attempt together to force the door to get out; for though we ſhould dye there, we had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end ſo than otherwiſe. All his diſciples an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they would aſſiſt him in all things, and that the recompence of the perill they were to hazard themſelves in, conſiſted in his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Thereupon they held their peace, and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi> conſidering this bloudy conſpiration, judged that hee ought to prevent the effect thereof, and that he was obliged to advertiſe the Lord againſt whom it was made thereof, eſteeming it was rather the providence of heaven which had conducted
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54530:59"/>him to the ſlaves door, then his curioſitie. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaying the coming of the Italian Lord his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from entertaining the Vice-Roy, he went to the entry of the chamber, and made him bee called, and ſuccinctly inſtructed him with the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſigne of the Infidels. The Cavalier entered againe into the Vice-Royes chamber, and led <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi> with him, that he might heare him, and might looke for preſent remedy for the danger that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened him. At the beginning he doubted of the truth of this relation; but ſeeing that <hi>Ricard</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him of the honour and honeſty of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, he thanked him for his advertiſement. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe,</hi> who had a ſubtle wit, made the Vice-Roy yet more beholden to him, teaching him an induſtry how to make theſe ſlaves feele the effect of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill they had plotted. Sir, ſayd he, your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency ſhall command that they bring you a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall that hath deſerved death, the which ſhall bee armed to the neck in a coate of Maile, and put on one of your rich Sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This being done, occaſion muſt bee given to the ſlave who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee the head, die moſt diſpoſed, and the ſtrongeſt of the conſpiratours (as farre as I have been able to obſerve by the cranny of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54530:60"/>door) to hide himſelfe where he will: Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſhall in the interim bee ſafe, and your guard ſhall be ready to fall, as well upon the executors of this deteſtable project, as upon the the complices, to the end that none of them may eſcape. So you ſhall triumph over theſe Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers, and thanke God for having preſerved you, by my intermiſſion; for the which I thanke him of my part, and eſteeme my ſelfe moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
                  <p>The next morning all was executed as it had been propounded; the groomes of the chamber, and other ſervants of the Vice-Roy, went and came into the chamber where the criminall was diſguiſed, with the ſame reſpect as if it had been their Maiſter: having left them all alone, and hee faigning to bee aſleep, the ſlave that was hidden came ſoftly, and holding his breath for feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, fell upon the criminall, and gave him five or ſix blowes with a knife upon the belly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in habits Royall) but without offending him, becauſe his coat of Maile guarded him: At the cryes of the criminall, the Gaurds of the Vice-Roy came running; but as they preſented the points of their Partizans to this ſlave to ſtay him; he ſeeing he was not ſuccoured by his companions, thinking he had killed the Vice-Roy, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe three ſtabs into his left ſide, whereof he died, before he could bee carryed out of the chamber, which he had ſtained with his infamous blood.</p>
                  <p>The Vice-Roy beheld this ſpectacle with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, being greatly aſtoniſhed therewith. He imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Feniſe,</hi> and prayed him to take ſuch part with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54530:60"/>him as he pleaſed, to the end that when time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould be preſented he might teſtifie unto him, how much he eſteemed his ſervice he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him. <hi>Ricard</hi> counſelled him to accept the Vice-Roy's offer, aſſuring him that he was a magnanimous ſeigneur who knew well how to acknowledge the merits of brave men; and <hi>Feniſe</hi> not being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to neglect his good will,, determined to ſtay there, and expect what it would pleaſe fortune to doe with him. In ſucceſſion of time his capacitie got him ſo familiar an acceſſe to the Vice-Roy, that he had no affaire which the other had not particular knowledge of: ſo that he conſulted with him of all things of importance. In the end to ſatisfie in ſome ſort the obligation he had to him, he made him governour of the towne of <hi>Tarente</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſeeing himſelfe honoured with this charge, made excuſes of his inſufficiency; yet he accepted it, for feare of offending the judgment of the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur which had made choice of his prudence and fidelity. He departed by the commandement of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> to take poſſeſſion of this adminiſtration in which he made appeare, that he perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood politique things, to the great contentment of the honorable men of the towne, and glory of him that had inſtalled him in this Government. He was accuſtomed to goe out almoſt every night, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied onely with two men, of whoſe valour and fidelitie he was aſſured, to the end to obſerve and chaſtice the lurkers, to whom the obſcuritie ſeemed to give licence; one night entring into a ſtreet, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ordinary round, he heard a doore ſhut a far off, and advancing that way, he perceived by a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54530:61"/>houſe ſide, a repreſentation of ſome thing which he could not diſcerne by reaſon of the night, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched with his company, and ſaw that it was a woman, almoſt all covered, with a great and rich looſe garment, which hid her face: they would have diſcovered it but me reſiſted; and for to oblige her thereunto without violence, they told her that it was the governour of the towne that commanded her: then this unknowne perſon drew out a piſtoll and preſented it to the head of <hi>Feniſe</hi> in drawing the tricker, but by good fortune for the Governour it went not off, at the ſame inſtant this woman let fall her piſtoll and trading up her garment turned her legs into wings and fled almoſt as faſt as a bird could doe; one of theſe two men that accompanied <hi>Feniſe</hi> ran after her, and the other conducted this too vigilant governour to his houſe; from thence he went to ſeeke the officers of Juſtice, to breake open this houſe and know who was therein lodged, to diſcover from whence came this attempt. They found there two women, the one faire and young, the other hideous and old, whom they tooke priſoners: this being done they followed him that was gone after her that would have killed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, wherein they uſed ſuch diligence, that they led her with the others; as they beheld her more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly With a candle, they knew that it was a man diſguiſed like a woman, they left him there putting irons upon him, untill the next day. The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, <hi>Feniſe</hi> was advertiſed of what had been done by his commandement, and knowing that the perſon that would have killed him was a man, he was extreamely aſtoniſhed. He went into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54530:61"/>and made him be brought before him. It was a man of a good countenance and habited after the Spaniſh faſhion. <hi>Feniſe</hi> having beheld him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred himſelſe, that he had before ſeene him, but it was a confuſed knowledg before he had asked him any queſtion, the priſoner prayed him to be pleaſed that the company might withdraw, that he would tell him a buſineſſe of importance, and which meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be kept ſecret.</p>
                  <p>The aſſiſtants being retired , <hi>Feniſe</hi> asked him what ſubject he had to attempt againſt his life, what he was, and if that he bad heretofore ſeene him in <hi>Spaine.</hi> For your firſt demand anſwered the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you may already be informed, that I had noe deſigne againſt your perſon; beſides upon another occaſion I have ſerved you as a defendor, in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous incounter.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE TRAGIQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E LOVES OF <hi>MARCEL.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT this day juſt a yeare ſince I left my country and five ſince I knew the cauſe of my travels, in a woman more faire then rich, and more noble then wiſe. It was upon the ſea ſhore neere <hi>Valence,</hi> where I firſt ſaw this beauty, and where I became her ſlave. You ſhall diſpence with me for telling you the meanes I uſed to win her, for feare of troubling you, &amp; alſo becauſe there is nothing rare therein, becauſe I found no great difficulty. At the firſt ſhe affected me, becauſe I gave her preſents; for it is long agoe ſince liberalitie hath beene the mother of love: ſhe alſo would have given me all that ſhe had; but I would never receive any thing but the recompence which my love merited. During the ſpace of foure yeares wee had two children; but as all things in this world tyre us in the end, yea vices themſelves, I grew weary of her company, which diſtaſt had more power over me then the pricks of my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I reſolved to ſeparate my ſelf from her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and laſcivious converſation, and for reaſons ſeemed to me very juſt, I attempted to perſwade her to conſent to this deſigne: but ſhe thereupon grew in choler, and anſwered me, that I ſhould take heed what I did, and never hereafter hold her ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, for if I paſſed further, ſhe would uſe ſuch extremities as ſhould extremely ſcandalize all
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54530:62"/>that ſhould be ſpectators thereof, yea, and thoſe that ſhould but heare them recounted. Oh if all the World could but heare the ſucceſſe of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, they would finde by experience in my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, how dangerous it is to perſevere in unlawfull affections, and know to what exceſſes a woman corrupted doth abandon her ſelf. I made no great matter of her threatnings, believing that in time ſhe would be appeaſed, and agree to my propoſitions, ſo that I quit her from that time; but as I fled her, ſhe followed me, yet ſhe loſt her paines. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt woman finds her ſelf a foole when ſhe is once hated, and reduced to ſue to a man; the more ſhe travails, the leſſe ſhe profits; the more ſhe loves, the leſſe ſhe is beloved; the more ſhe teſtifies her paſſion, the leſſe ſhe obligeth, and it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her ſelf more odious. Seeing then my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects, or rather my diſdaines, and the little power her love had over me, ſhe invented the moſt horrible cruelty that is poſſible for a humane heart to commit. She intreated me by a Letter to come ſee her at the leaſt once, that ſhe might reſolve with more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience upon our divorce: I thought that I ſhould have been too rigorous to have denied her this contentment; ſo that to ſatisfie her, I went one night to her, accompanied with two of my friends, who ſtayed for me at the door; I found her all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in her chamber, with a look very deſolate; ſhe commanded her ſervant to retire, then ſhe made me a ſtudied diſcourſe, where Art and Eloquence were ſo ingeniouſly joyned, that it would have ſhaken a conſtancy weaker then mine. In the end feeing that her endeavours were too weak, ſhe aroſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54530:63"/>up and bad me good night; at the ſame time I took leave of her, and went down from her chamber; I was ſcarcely in the Court, when ſhe appeared at the window of another chamber, and calling to me, ſet a torch in the window, holding a ponyard in one hand, and in the other one of the children I had by her, to the which ſhe gave two ſtabs in the breaſt, and caſt it at my feet upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as I begun to cry out, full of horrour and amazement, ſeeing the action of this Fury, ſhe took the other child and ſerved it as ſhe had done the firſt, ſaying that ſhe would not keep the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a faithleſſe and ungratefull perſon. Alas! the cruell Tygreſſe had inticed them to her houſe by ſubtilty for this tragick end. I was at the charge to have them brought up in another place: I ran into the chamber again with my ſword in my hand, but I found that ſhe had ſhut the door. I ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to break it, and thereupon appeared an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known man in armes, which ſhe had hidden for to murder me; but at the noiſe we made, my friends came running in with a torch, and he ſeeing them approach, leapt out of a Balconia into the ſtreet for to ſave himſelf; my friends went down to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and at the inſtant this imaged woman, all bloudy, holding her ponyard in her hand, who thinking that I was taken by her catch-pole, came to ſerve him as Second, and plunge her dagger in my heart if ſhe had been able; but my fury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her rage, and cauſed me to give her two great blowes with my ſword, wherewith I caſt her to the ground, where ſhe immediately died. This being done, I went after my friends, and found
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54530:63"/>that they had catched and mortally wounded their man, who demanded for confeſſion: In approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, I ſaw him fall to the ground, and at the ſame time we perceived another, who knocked at a door, which obliged us to a ſudden retreat, and the next day to leave the Towne. At theſe words <hi>Feniſe</hi> made reflection, and acknowledged that there are few murderers which are preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; for he remembred himſelf that theſe were they that had fled for killing the man that fell dead before the door of <hi>Laure,</hi> when he knocked for to enter there the night that he had revenged himſelf of his treacherous friends <hi>Don Jouan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe follies were the cauſe that I left my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try continued <hi>Marcell.</hi> I took the way to <hi>Barcelone,</hi> where I ſtayed ſix moneths; from thence I came into this Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> in a veſſell full of men belonging to the Vice-Roy. Two daies after my imbarkment, I perceived a woman in this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, faire in perfection: I informed my ſelf who ſhe was, and I was told that one of the principall Gentlemen of the Vice-Roy conducted her, which obliged me to retaine my ſelfe, and hindred me from ſuing to her, for ſhe begun to move my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. We arrived happily at <hi>Naples,</hi> where this Gentleman hired a houſe, and then I begun to court her. During this time, ſhe ſent one night to ſeeke me, and told me that I could hope nothing from her if I did not carry her out of <hi>Naples;</hi> that ſhe would chuſe no place, but that I ſhould carry her whither I would.</p>
                  <p>This proportion joyned to ſome other markes made me judge that ſhe was of a changeable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54530:64"/>but foraſmuch as my love regarded nothing but to be ſatisfied, I diſpoſed my ſelfe to obey her in what ſhe would wiſh; I ſtole her from <hi>Naples</hi> the ſame night that ſhe had ſpoken to me thereof, and in all the Towns we paſſed I found none ſo fair as ſhe: I hired a houſe, and furniſhed it with all things neceſſary for a Family; but whatſoever familiarity I had with her, I could not poſſibly obtain the laſt ſatisfaction of my deſires, ſhe put me off from day to day, and when I thought I was arrived at the term, ſhe found inventions to prolong it anew, yet without making my paſſion exceed the limits of reſpect. It happened at that time that the Vice-Roy gave you the charge of Governour of this Town, which you execute ſo worthily, to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and your own glory, and the generall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all the people; and <hi>Laure</hi> having known your arrivall, and ſeen your perſon, (ſo this char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming beauty is called) ſhe told me, that if I would do her a ſignall ſervice, and oblige her to accord to me the accompliſhment of my deſires, I muſt take away your life, telling me that ſhe mortally hated you, becauſe you had ſlain one of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that ſhe ſhould never be at reſt untill ſhe was revenged of you; this was without doubt the cauſe that moved her to leave <hi>Naples,</hi> having known that you was there. But I, who have alwaies had a certaine inclination to honour you, both ſeeing on one ſide that ſhe would not conſent to my wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es if I did not execute what ſhe had ordained me, and alſo on the other ſide, that I could not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe nor commit ſo extreame a cowardiſe againſt your perſon, which I perfectly eſteem and affect, we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54530:64"/>thus made our complot. That I ſhould uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence to accompliſh her revenge, untill I could diſcharge a piſtoll upon you, and although you ſhould not dye thereby, ſhe ſhould accord unto me what I demanded, ſince that I had done my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to execute her will. She accepted this bargain upon condition that ſhe might ſee the piſtoll diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which was eaſie for her to doe, ſince that you paſſed very often by her ſtreet and windowes: our treaty being thus concluded, I diſguiſed my ſelfe in a womans garment, and ſhe ſaw me in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence charge my piſtoll with two good bullets, but in expecting you I drew out the two bullets, to the end that if it had taken fire, you might have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no dammage, thoſe that took up the piſtoll can verifie what I ſay. Seeing you enter into the ſtreet, I gave a certaine ſigne to give her advice thereof; at the inſtant I heard her open her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to ſee this tragick action, which ſhe hoped for, and wherein ſhe was deceived, ſince that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as you know. If this ſtratagem merit puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having been invented to enjoy a beauty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately beloved, I deſerve to be chaſtiſed with ſuch puniſhment as you ſhall pleaſe to ordain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſpoſe of me as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Since <hi>Feniſe</hi> had heard the name of <hi>Laure,</hi> his Spirit was in perpetuall perplexity, knowing the extream wickedneſſe of this woman, whom he had dearly loved, and reſolving to revenge himſelf of her; to the purpoſe he praiſed the invention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Marcel</hi> had abuſed her to ſave his life. He imbraced him, and thanked him for the affection he had teſtified to him, and which he had rendred
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54530:65"/>him in an occaſion ſo dangerous, and in the ſame time he commanded that his irons ſhould be taken away, ſaying that ſince there was none offended but himſelfe, he would pardon himſelfe withall his heart.</p>
                  <p>In the interim <hi>Laure</hi> who ſaw her ſelfe falne into <hi>Feniſe</hi> his hands, would have enterpriſed a thouſand times to have deſtroyed her ſelfe by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſteele, or cord, if the old woman that was with her had not hindred her, telling her that ſhe ſhould net deſpaire, and that the evill could not be ſo great as ſhe could not remedy. <hi>Feniſe</hi> on the other ſide beat his braines how to invent how he might revenge himſelfe of this cruell without noyſe. Hee would not ſee her in her priſon, for feare the violence of his anger ſhould cauſe him to commit ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exceſſe: a thing extreame ill in a governour and magiſtrate: but he reſolved to convey her into ſome place where without witneſſes he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine her, &amp; make her give account of her life. The better to accompliſh his deſign, he delivered the old woman that accompanied her who ſeeing her ſelfe at liberty, gave new hopes to <hi>Laure</hi> to ſolicite and and obtaine her deliverance at what price ſo ever it ſhould be. After having tryed all meanes poſſible, and ſeeing ſhe advanced nothing, ſhe addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelfe to a <hi>Magician,</hi> from whom ſhe got a writing and a ring which ſhe brought her aſſuring her, that if ſhe tooke it from her finger when ſhee found her ſelfe in any danger in ſpeaking words contayned in that paper which ſhe gave her, ſhe ſhould ſurmount it. That ſhe ſhould not at all be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of what ſhould be preſented before her, that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54530:65"/>ſhe ſhould be aſſiſted with ſuccours more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, which ſhould overcome the force of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> impatient to execute his revengfull project, made ingeniouſly to be reported amongſt thoſe that knew of the impriſonment of <hi>Laure;</hi> that having found her innocent by the depoſitions of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red priſoner and <hi>Alcinoe</hi> her companion, he would alſo oblige her with the ſame favour. For this effect he ſent for her one night by a man he confided in, who told her that he had charge from the governour to conduct her to a towne four leagues from <hi>Tarente,</hi> where he was to leave her. She truſting in the charms which <hi>Alcinoe</hi> had given her, preſently reſolved to goe with this man. He ſet her upon his horſe behinde him, and by night carryed her to a Rendez-vouſe where <hi>Feniſe</hi> was to meete him as he did, being there he commanded the conductor of <hi>Laure</hi> to leave him, and to returne to <hi>Tarente. Laure</hi> ſeeing her ſelfe thus abuſed; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to the mercy of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> whom the paſſion of vengeance furiouſly inflamed, began to take off her inchanted ring, and ſpeake the words which were given her. Vpon the inſtant before that <hi>Feniſe</hi> could ſpeake any word, he ſaw himſelfe invironed with a whirlewinde and duſt ſo thick that he could ſee nothing about him; preſently he imagined that there was ſome magique in this accident: he armed himſelfe with the ſigne of a chriſtian, and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, this obſcuritie was changed into lightneſſe; which nevertheleſſe frighted him more then the darkeneſſe, for he ſaw himſelfe invironed with fire, whoſe flames ſeemed to mount unto the clouds, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54530:66"/>although he was in ſo terrible a danger he did not forbeare to looke about where <hi>Laure</hi> was, but the he ſaw her no more, not knowing whether the flames had devoured her, or ſome divell had carryed her away in the whirlewinde and duſt. In fine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtayed ſome time to conſider this prodigious viſion, from whence he knew not how to eſcape, he he heard a fearefull thunder in the ayre, and at the ſame inſtant the fire went out, and he found himſelfe all alone without having ſuffered any hurt, but that of feare; heaven grew cleare and the moone ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bright, which gave him meanes to finde his horſe, he came on, he got on horſe backe and returned to <hi>Tarente,</hi> his minde filled with a thouſand confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well with what he had ſeene, as the doubt he was in that the divells had carryed away <hi>Laure,</hi> to chaſtiſe her themſelves, or if they were ſo much her friends, that they had raviſhed her to defend her from the effects of his vengeance. Being arrived at his houſe, he ſent for <hi>Marcel,</hi> and told him all that had paſſed, whereupon they diſcourſed together ſome time; without being able to judge any thing certainely.</p>
                  <p>At that time <hi>Marcel</hi> tooke leave of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> with a thouſand faire complements and as many proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of amitie made of one ſide and of the other. He returned to <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſtayed yet a yeare in his government. Then he received a letter from the Vice-Roy which obliged him to goe preſently to him; and at his arrivall he gave him a pacquet which he had received from <hi>Don Ambroſio</hi> his father, who finding himſelfe old and feeble deſired to ſee him yet once before he left this world. The Vice-Roy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54530:66"/>approving this paternall feeling and ſeeing the good nature of <hi>Feniſe</hi> who was very willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his father, permitted him to goe for <hi>Spaine</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition he would returne as ſoon as he could poſſible; promiſing alſo of his part to render him at his returne more ſignall teſtimonies of the eſteem he made of his merit. With this civill leave <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi> left <hi>Naples</hi> and went towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the town he deſired to ſee before he returned into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, judging that he might be accuſed of little cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie to have left <hi>Italy,</hi> without ſeeing ſo marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a Citie.</p>
                  <p>From thence he went to <hi>Florence;</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voyage, he arrived at the foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> where night tooke him farre from the place where he hoped to have lodged. And whether it was hee knew not the way, or that Fortune would yet play with him, he loſt himſelfe, if one may call that a loſſe, which cauſed him to obtaine the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt treaſure his ſpirit could have knowledge of. Beſides the coming on of the night, he was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with a violent tempeſt of thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (which made him remember that wherein he was when he had deſigne to be revenged of <hi>Laure.</hi>) After which heaven poured downe ſuch torrents of raine, which gliding downe the Mountaines, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened our adventerour to force him into the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices. In the end, after having ſuffered much paine and apprehenſion, he ſaw himſelfe (by the light of a flaſh of lightning) neare the mouth of a deep ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne; he approached it, yet fearing by ſaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from one danger, to caſt himſelfe into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, imagining that this place under ground, was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54530:67"/>the retreate of ſome Beares or Lyons; he had no intention to enter therein, but onely ſo farre as to guard himſelfe from the raine that fell from the clouds: but he had ſcarcely begunne to ſtay and take breath, when he perceived a light within the cave. Divers thoughts came into his minde, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he was falne into the hands of ſome Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gands, and after having conſulted a little what hee ought to doe, he reſolved to try his fortune in this occaſion; he called two or three times, but there was nothing but the eccho of his voice which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him. Then animating his reſolution, he tied his horſe to a buſh, and approaching to the light, he ſaw extended upon the ground a humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, having a face yellow, leane, and waſted; in briefe, ſo hideous, that ſhe ſeemed to be death it ſelfe. Her body was covered with a coat of haire-cloth, rude, and pricking, her haire was yellow, and ſo long, that it was able to cover her whole body; her hands dry, and without fleſh, being croſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her breaſt, embracing a Croſſe of a meane great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which leaned upon her mouth: finally, all her body was an originall of death, and a lively i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a ſharpe pennance. Our Cavalier beheld this body with a great deale of pitty, and a great deſire to have a more cleare knowledge thereof. When <hi>Aurora</hi> begunne to lend him her feeble light, the better to diſtinguiſh the particulars of this ſtrange ſolitude, or rather this living Sepulcher, he ſaw upon a ſeate of the Rock, a bloody diſcipline, and a larum bell, under which were written theſe words, <hi>Remember thy end;</hi> neare the Lampe, from whence proceeded the light he had ſeen, was a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54530:67"/>accompanyed with the images of the Virgin, and Saint <hi>John</hi> the well-beloved Diſciple, where theſe Letters were engraven, <hi>T. I. T. B. O. A. P. W. I. D. T. R. A. Feniſe</hi> would have given them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers interpretations, but hee could not finde one that would come neare the ſignification of what he ſaw. After hee had a long time contemplated theſe ſad objects, not daring to touch the body, for feare of prophaning it. He judged that ſince there was fire maintained by oyle, there muſt needs bee ſome one about this cave, that had care to furniſh, and entertaine it with that element. He went out for to ſatisfie this deſire, but he was ſcarcely out of the den, when the mouth thereof was ſuddainly ſhut by a great peece of ſtone which ſeemed to be mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly falne from the Rock for that purpoſe, as he went by little and little from this cave, by the ſame paces he came which were printed in the ſlimy earth, he perceived (the day being then begunne) a man of ſo ſtrange a forme, that hee had doubted what creature he was, if his motion had not given him a more particular knowledge, having approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him, he ſaw an old man, tall, his hair white, and very long, his face leane, his beard reached unto his girdle, a patched coate that covered his body unto his knees, holding a Rozaire in one hand, and a little book in the other. <hi>Feniſe</hi> called him, he lifted up his eyes (for yet he had not ſeen him) and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aſtoniſhed to ſee another man then himſelfe, yet hee was not froward nor fled, but approached ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Feniſe,</hi> and informed himſelfe by what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he was come into a place ſo farre from the highwayes, then he carried him into his Cell made
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54530:68"/>betwixt two Rockes, the doore whereof was ſo little, that with great difficultie could a man enter therein, without going upon his knees, there was a window made by nature, by which hee had ſo much light as was neceſſary, although he enjoyed almoſt none thereof; he made him ſit downe upon his bed, which was a long ſtone made like a Tomb, and after many diſcourſes, this good penitent to ſatisfie the deſires of the Cavalier recited unto him this prodigious hiſtory.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ABout threeſcore yeares agoe, I was borne in the City of <hi>Capoue,</hi> iſſued of rich Parents, and at the ſame time a Magiſtrate of the towne of <hi>Luques</hi> had a ſonne ſo like me, as if nature had formed us in the ſame mould, his face, hair, voice, proportion, and geſture, did ſo much reſemble mine, or mine ſo paralell his, that it was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. In receiving Baptiſme, I was called <hi>Charles,</hi> and my paralell <hi>Albert;</hi> we grew up during our tender age in equalitie of manners, and alſo of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, which diſpoſed of our perſons in ſuch ſort, that having attained the age of twenty yeares, we met at <hi>Venice,</hi> where we grew acquainted one with another, or rather with our ſelves. From this perfect reſemblance, grew a ſtrict amitie, which was never broken, we dwelt together, we had but one table, and one bed.</p>
                  <p>After a little time, there happened an affliction
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54530:68"/>to me, which obliged me to abſent my ſelfe, my mother dyed in the middle of her youth, and quit this ſad habitation to goe to heaven; I may ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume from her vertues and beauty; for there is no commendation ſo proper to expreſſe her worth, as to ſay ſhe was faire, and alſo vertuous. <hi>Albert</hi> left <hi>Venice</hi> with me, and went to <hi>Luques.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved our affections by the means of Letters, which are the ſweeteſt entertaines of abſent friends; but we were not abſent one from another; for <hi>Albert</hi> never looked in his glaſſe, nor I in mine, that hee ſaw not me, and I likewiſe him. I was twenty two yeares old, when my Father followed my Mother, leaving me his benediction for heritage, with ſome ſmall temporall goods which he poſſeſſed; he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me with the feare of God, Charitie towards the poore, and fidelitie to my friends, and principally towards <hi>Albert,</hi> and gave up the ghoſt, in giving me this wholeſome counſell; he was laid in the Sepulcher of his ancient predeceſſors: I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in his poſſeſſions, which I enjoyed not long in quiet, the malice and envy of ſome of my kindred, ſo rigorouſly perſecuted me, that I was forced to ſpend the greateſt part of my goods in ſuites and pettifoggings, untill I was forced to leave my country. I left it to ſeeke repoſe elſwhere, and being followed with tenne men, which I treated as my friends, I went towards <hi>Luques,</hi> where I thought to finde my deare <hi>Albert,</hi> but he was gone to comfort me, having heard of the death of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This teſtimony of his affection made mee ſweare not to returne into my country untill I had found him, to give him thankes, and renew
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54530:69"/>our ſored vowes. He did the ſame having learned that I was gone to ſeeke him; for it ſeemed our ſoules had conſulted their deſignes together. In execution of this project, I viſited many townes, where amongſt others, I met with one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient friends of my father, who having courteouſly received me, and kept me a long time at his houſe, he gave me his onely daughter in marriage called <hi>Lesbie,</hi> with a great portion. A yeare and a halfe after I had married her, I was told that <hi>Albert</hi> was in <hi>France,</hi> in the Province now called <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> and that one might heare of him at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> or at <hi>Tholouſe:</hi> This news awakened the deſigne and deſire I had to ſee him. I departed, accompanyed with the ſame men that came with me from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poue,</hi> and as we approached neare <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> wee met in a ſpacious field, near to the ſide of a wood, a little troope of men of equall number to ours, they ſtayed as ſoon as they had perceived us; we belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving they were theeves, whereof this country was full, and they having the ſame opinion of us; our ignorance made us betake our ſelves to our armes, and came to the ſhock one againſt another, where there had been a bloody encounter, if Gob had not put himſelfe into the middle. The greateſt part of us, as well of the one ſide as of the other, had upon our heads (as they then commonly wore in <hi>France,</hi> and wherewith they ſerve themſelves to this day) Bocquincans or Tapabors, which covers the moſt part of the face, ſo that we being mingled together, wee could ſcarcely know one another: then fearing ſome great diſorder amongſt my men, I diſcovered my face, and put my Tapabor upon my
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54530:69"/>ſhoulders and under my chinne, to bee the better knowne to my friends, and immediately one of my adverſaries came to me in a reſpectfull manner, <hi>Seigneur Albert,</hi> ſayd he, it would bee well for you to give the ſign of retreate, that our party may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from our enemies, and that we may diſcerne them, we ſhall bee thereby the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. At the ſame time hee heard the ſigne given wherof he ſpoke, and ſeeing that I was not <hi>Albert,</hi> as he believed, and that his companions being reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, came to ſet upon us againe, he turned himſelfe towards them, being already cenfuſed; What doe you meane by this Gentlemen, ſaid he, are you mad or blinde, that you will needs offend our Chiefe? Doe you not ſee <hi>Seigneur Albert?</hi> At that name they all ſtayed, and I having heard him name <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> twice, I cryed out, peace, peace, friends, friends. Thereupon <hi>Albert,</hi> who heard my voice, abandoned his Tapabor, and his Sword, and came to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe about my neck, and I knowing him, we remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo faſt locked together, that there had like to have come miſchiefe thereby; for our horſes who did not know one the other, beganne to rage one againſt the other, but our friends prevented it; for our joyes were ſo exceſſive, that we tooke no heed thereof, we lighted and entertained one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, with our moſt particular ſecrets; afterwards with extreame joy of both fides, we entered into <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> I made a little ſtay with him, but the affection I bore to my wife obliged me to leave him, with promiſe to ſee him againe very ſhortly. <hi>Albert</hi> habited himſelfe afer the French faſhion, to teſtifie the eſteeme he had of that nation, which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54530:70"/>gave him acceſs into the houſe of a great Lord of that Realme, which bore the title of a Duke, and who ordinarily dwelt at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> the eminent qualities of <hi>Albert,</hi> who was expert in all exerciſes fit for a Gentleman, beſides his wit and ſweet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (which made him welcome into all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies whatſoever) got ſo great familiaritie with this Duke, that after he knew his wit, hee would have him alwaies in his company, and at his table. He had a daughter perfectly faire, as well of body as mind: And as the converſation with Ladies is much more free in <hi>France</hi> then in <hi>Italy, Albert</hi> had the honour to be often in her company with other companions, where they reciprocally knew one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers merits, in ſuch manner that within a little time they thought well one of another. <hi>Albert</hi> was willing to take the occaſion which ſeemed to invite him to a good fortune, he begun to court this young Lady, and teſtifie to her that he had vowed his liberty to her ſervice, ſometimes by Letters, ſometimes by verſes, which he recited in ſinging and playing upon the Lute in the very preſence of her Father; for amongſt the other fair parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was accompliſhed, he poſſeſſed theſe two graces from the Muſes of Poetry and Muſick, to which I alſo took pleaſure to addict my ſelf, to the end that our likeneſſe might be the more perfect. In the end he explicated himſelf ſo intelligibly, and played his part ſo well, that he inſinuated himſelf into her favour, ſo far as ſhe permitted him one night to come ſee her in her chamber. A great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence in a Maid of ſuch condition, which ought to be ſo much the more carefull to keep her ſelf ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54530:70"/>more to loſe then one of leſſe quality; but there is no retinue nor limits to a woman that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers her ſelf to be blinded with that fooliſh paſſion. There was in this Dukes Court a certain <hi>Gaſconian</hi> Cavalier, called <hi>Arnalt,</hi> which had obtained <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> affection, and the place of confident which he before had, and knew ſo well how to play his part, that he got out of <hi>Alberts</hi> heart all his ſecrets, whoſe freedom preſumed he would never betray him; but it happened to him as it doth ordinarily to thoſe who diſcover themſelvs too freely unto others whom they have not proved. <hi>Albert</hi> did not only content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to declare unto him his affections, but he made uſe of him as a Scout, when he went to receive the greateſt favours from <hi>Matilda</hi> (ſo was the Dukes daughter called) thus was he puniſhed by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, ſo injudiciouſly choſen. This perfidious friend, envious of <hi>Alberts</hi> contentment, excited by the inclination he had to doe miſchief, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ſecrets which were revealed unto him, being one day neare the Duke, who praiſed the merits of <hi>Albert,</hi> audaciouſly interrupted him, ſaying, that he was ſorry his bounty ſhould be ſo abuſed by a treacherous ſtranger, which violated the honour of his Linage, and who by his pernicious cunning had abuſed his daughter <hi>Matilda.</hi> The Duke, who held <hi>Albert</hi> for a vertuous Gentleman, &amp; his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be too wiſe and retained to fall into ſuch an inconvenience, and on the other ſide conſidering <hi>Arnalts</hi> reputation, from whom every one fled as from a wicked ſpirit, told him he was raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, to uſe ſuch impudent language; thereupon <hi>Albert</hi> arrived, to whom the Duke told this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54530:71"/>accuſation of <hi>Arnalt,</hi> wherewith he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſurpriſed. Yet without teſtifying exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly the motion of his heart, he anſwered to the Duke, that he ſhould think he did wrong to the eſteem and honour which he had teſtified to him, if he ſhould go about to excuſe the crime wherewith this traitor accuſed him, but that if he pleaſed to permit him to have ſatisfaction from him, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence ſhould be known, to the confuſion of his accuſer. The Duke ſeeing <hi>Albert</hi> ſpeak with ſo much reſolution, anſwered him, that he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, and that the offence was his: But that ſince he took part in the injury, and would take vengeance for it, he praiſed his generoſity, and granted him the combate for the next day. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after that <hi>Albert</hi> had obtained this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and that he was retired to prepare himſelf for the duell, I arrived at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and ſent to let him know thereof; he came to me, and after our reciprocall embracements, he told me the trouble wherein traytor <hi>Arnalt</hi> had ingaged him, and that he did a little doubt of the ſucceſſe, not for want of valour, but becauſe the truth was not of his ſide, ſo he was to fight againſt double armes. Having heard all theſe circumſtances, my heart was ſeized with extream ſadneſſe, conſidering that his ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had cauſed him to ſtain the Houſe of this Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or with ſo great infamy. I would willingly have ſhewn him his fault, but when things are paſſed, they are without remedy. In concluſion, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long time reaſoned and conſulted together, I found no courſe ſo expedient as that I ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the combate for him, and convert the verity
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54530:71"/>which <hi>Arnalt</hi> maintained into a lye, juſtifying that I had never violated the honour of <hi>Matilda,</hi> and that by force of Armes. But <hi>Albert</hi> too cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and who felt his conſcience charged with this crime, would never permit me to expoſe my life for his expiation: We conteſted ſome time thereupon, but ſeeing that I could not make him condiſcend to my propoſition, I bethought my ſelf of another courſe, and counſelled him to perſwade his enemy to take a ſecond; but he anſwered me as he had before done, that he would not engage others innocency with his ſinne, that he was reſolved to hazard his fortune alone; that he would put himſelf in good ſtate before he entred the Liſts, and would aske God pardon for his crime; and if it pleaſed him to give him the Victory over the traytor, in whom he had too lightly confided, he would content himſelf in making him ask his life; and at the worſt of the ill chance fell upon him, he hoped that his bloud would waſh away his iniquity, and that he ſhould dye with extream repentance for having don ſo infamous an injury to a Seigneur that dearly loved him, and to whom he was ſo behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In ſaying this, he left me, and went to the place aſſigned, with tears in mine eyes, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in my heart, ſeeing him goe to maintain ſo ill a quarrell. Two houres after I heard the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick rumour of the ſucceſſe of this combate, where I learned that the two enemies had no advantage the one over the other, ſince that either of them had by his death received the juſt puniſhment of his offence; <hi>Arnalt</hi> of his treaſon, and <hi>Albert</hi> for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the virginity of <hi>Matilda;</hi> they pierced
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54530:72"/>one an others bodyes with their lances, and fel upon the place, where they expired almoſt at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the great aſtoniſhment of the ſpectators. You may better imagine the diſpleaſure which ſeiſed my heart, then I can repreſent it unto you by words, I will onely tell you that I was ſo ſenſible thereof that I fell ſick, which hindred me from rendering him the laſt honours which we owe to our friends, and that I ſhould have rendered to him as to the halfe of my ſelfe, But as one misfortune ſerves ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily for Harbinger to another, being recovered and returned to my houſe, I found it altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and in diſorder by the deceaſe of her who was the joy of my familie. At my arrivall I wanted not much of committing ſome outrage upon my perſon, through deſpaire, ſeeing my ſelfe deprived of two ſuch pretious things, as I had not the like in the world, my friend and wife, I had a ſonne by her, who hindred me from this fury: after I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted him heire and univerſall poſſeſſor of the eſtate fortune had given me, and not being willing to ſurvive after the death of <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>Lesbie;</hi> I reſolved to enterre my ſelfe alive in this deſert, where I have made my retreat this twenty yeares, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt ſweet repoſe, and proving all the felicities that I have heretofore heard or read of ſolitude. Since which time I have alwaies lived alone, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a yeare agoe, going amongſt the rocks to ſearch hearbes and rootes to ſuſtaine this poore life, when the night begun to baniſh the light, I perceived amongſt the broome a perſon whoſe feeble and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife voice invited me to ſuccour her. I preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and ſaw a woman of good faſhion who as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54530:72"/>ſoone as ſhe had perceived me, asked me if I was not called <hi>Simeon,</hi> for inchanging my life and manners, I alſo changed my name. Yes ſaid I in approaching to her, for my age being deprived of feelings of ſenſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and where concupiſcentiall heats were extinct, pemitted me to come to her with out any ſcruple, and to bring her where we now are: and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of her what ſhe was, ſhe made me this diſcourſe</p>
                  <p>I am a poore unfortunate and unhappy ſinner, whoſe life heaven hath conſerved to oblige me to diſpoſe of it in theſe deſerts. I was borne at <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where I was called <hi>Laure.</hi> It would be too troubleſome and offenſive to your holineſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you the particulars how I have ſpent my young yeares, I ſhall onely tell you, that I have run divers hazards in flying from the terrour that I had of a Cavalier who was offended with me, as in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he had cauſe. Thinking to ſhun the danger which I feared, I caſt my ſelfe therein. It is but foure dayes a gone ſince I was in the preſence of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, in quality of Judg, for a crime which I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, having attempted to make him be treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlaine. His countenance made me apprehend his rigour, his feeling my puniſhment, and his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his vengance. Then eſteeming it impoſſible to ſatisfie him by my ſubmiſſions; I had recourſe to an Inchantreſſe, to deliver me out of his hands, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible to eſcape by any other meanes. This Cavalier having cauſed me to be brought into his company in a ſecret place, for to tak away my life with this proper hands, I ſerved my ſelfe with the charmes which the Inchantreſſe had given me,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54530:73"/>which made me ſee feareful things, &amp; without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way I went, whether by earth, aire or the ſea I found my ſelfe in <hi>Florence.</hi> But although I ſaw my ſelfe free from him that threatened me, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles a ſlave to my proper conſcience which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured me without ceaſing. I made a general confeſſion &amp; from that howre, I found my ſelfe touched with a holy repentance of my faults, and with an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of my proper miſeries. Deſiring then to vow the reſt of my dayes to God, by the meanes of a ſevere penance, I have renounced the world and all the vanities thereof, and I doe not know by what inſtinct I have beene conducted, into this ſharpe and remote place, where I deſire to impriſon my body to deliver my ſoule, which I feare is in great danger to be deſtined to the priſons of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall darkneſſe. In finiſhing this laſt word, ſobs and teares came into her mouth and eyes, in ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance that it was impoſſible for her to ſpeake more. I was aſtoniſhed to ſee ſo great contrition, in ſo young a heart, and an election of a life ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that I imagined ſhe had before lead. My good friend ſaid I to her, your propoſition is very wholeſome, but I feare your delicateneſſe and the ordinary inconſtancy of your ſex will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from the execution thereof. At the leaſt having begun you will finde this change too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſupport. Yet if you have a good courage, God will fortifie you, and by little and little you will have cauſe to give him thankes, for the holy inſpirations he hath given you. Alas my daughter, a ſoule is happy that is diſpoſed for death before ſhe is called to it! It is the generall port of all humanes,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54530:73"/>but many have there ſuffered ſhipwrack for want of the guide which leadeth to ſafety, which is called pennance. If you then will ſave your ſelfe, and march under his conduct: I offer you all that you ſhal judg I can contribute to this deſigne, hoping by the grace &amp; aſſiſtance of God that you will attaine life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She anſwered me that ſince I would uſe ſo much charitie towards her, ſhe would be governed by my counſell, and would reſigne me all her will. After which ſhe choſe that dwelling, which you ſay you have ſeene, where ſhe leads an Angelicall life. I could tell you the particulars thereof, but worldly perſons as you are, take no great pleaſure in ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines, and alſo that perſon being but indifferent to you, it would be but a trouble to you. You ſhall onely know that three dayes ſince, ſhe rendered her ſoul to God, which I believe he hath received to recompence the ſharpe pennance which ſhe hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone. She hath left me here envious of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, happy if I can well imitate them. But I being with her when ſhe expired; I have graven thirteene letters which you ſaw in the ſtone, for it was not ſpacious enough to put more, they ſignifie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my ſence; <hi>This is the body of a</hi> Phenix <hi>which is dead to riſe againe.</hi>

                  <p>For as much as the death of juſt perſons is not called their death but birth; for as the humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his birth leaveth the ſeſible habitation of his mothers wombe, to come and live abroad; ſo the ſoules of them which leave this world in the grace of God, leave the corruptible priſons of their bodies, to enjoy eternall felicitie. Sir I have made you this troubleſome diſcourſe, as well to ſatisfie your deſire as to recreate my memory with things
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54530:74"/>paſt; for you know it is a ſingular pleaſure to old people to recount the adventures of their youthes.</p>
                  <p>Since that venerable <hi>Simeon</hi> had pronounced the name of <hi>Laure, Feniſe</hi> had much to doe to forbeare breaking the thread of his diſcourſe, to let him know how much he was intereſſed in this hiſtory. He ſighed at every word <hi>Simeon</hi> ſtayed, &amp; complained of his hard fortune, having ſo paſſionately loved this maid by whom he had been ſo ingratefully uſed. But in the end conſidering that God had called her to him by this ſalutary pennance, he was extreamely ſorry he had not knowne her in this cell, to have rendered her his laſt honours, in bedewing her feete with his teares, and asking her pardon for the deſigne which he had to kill her, and by that meanes deprive her of the ſaving of her ſoule.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Simeon</hi> left ſpeaking, <hi>Feaniſe</hi> begun to weep, and for to explicate from whence proceeded this tenderneſſe, he told him the extraction of <hi>Laure,</hi> and the courſe of her life untill the time ſhe had retired her ſelfe into that ſolitude, at which the ſolitary much wondred. Our Cavalier deſiring to continue his voyage, thanked <hi>Simeon</hi> for the entertainement he had given him; he prayed him to guide him to the foote of the rock where the cave was, that ſerved for tombe to this happy penitent, to take againe his horſe which he had left there, to the which the good man accorded, and more, conducted him into a foote way which led him into his way where having imbraced and taken their laſt leaves, <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> haſtily returned into his Cell repenting that he had imployed too much time in diſcourſing upon worldly vanities.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ee that is once embarqued upon the Sea, and arrives happily to Shoare, is much bounden to his fortune; and he conſideth in her too much, that putteth himſelfe a ſecond time upon that fearefull element. For my part, I thinke there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofe of courage, then to enterprise to paſſe a Gulf without neceſſity, or without being thereunto incited by covetouſneſſe. Fortune bears ſoveraign ſway over foure things, which are, Marriages, great Mens Favourites, Warres, and Navigations. But according to the opinion of many, the laſt is the moſt perillous: And from thence I draw this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, That if courage bee ſo neceſſary for the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54530:75"/>War, as being a perill much to be feared; the ſame courage is yet more requiſite in Navigation; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the danger there is altogether evident, having but the thickneſſe of a planke betwixt life and death. An author of reputation reported, that a certaine Conſul of <hi>Rome,</hi> durſt never hazard himſelfe upon the ſea, and being demanded from whence proceeded this feare, hee anſwered, The veſſell is a foole, ſince that ſhe is alwaies in motion, the Navigator is a foole, being never of the ſame opinion, the ſea is a foole ſince that ſhe is never in repoſe, and the aire is a foole, ſince that it runneth perpetually: And ſuppoſing that all theſe things are true, and that being upon the earth we fly from a foole, why would you have me truſt my life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt foure fooles, being upon the ſea? This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument deſerveth to be known, but not imitated; for if the Conſul is eſteemed prudent, he may alſo be accuſed of cowardlineſs.</p>
               <p>Our Cavalier was not of the ſect of this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, nor of his opinion, the deſire hee had to advance in his journey, made him reſolve to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque himſelfe at the port of <hi>Liuorne,</hi> and againe truſt his life to <hi>Neptune,</hi> hee there found a French Merchants ſhip, where he was welcome, and civilly lodged; for although it be hard to be ſo upon the ſea, yet money findeth all commodities. <hi>Feniſe</hi> was then well enough furniſhed therewith, as well by the liberalitie of the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> as the lawfull gaine he had made of the government of <hi>Tarente.</hi> And the opinion which thoſe of the ſhip had that he was rich, obliged them to beare him a certaine reſpect, as he gave them cauſe, for having
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54530:75"/>layd in good ſtoore of proviſion in the veſſell, hee parted it liberally amongſt the company, by which meanes he gained the hearts and affections of the Mariners and Patrons. All thoſe in the veſſell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing familiar together, endeavoured to paſſe the troubles of navigation with the ſweet witty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements they could deviſe. The Merchants were men of ſubtile underſtanding, and beſides there were in this company two young Italians, good humaniſts, and well knowing in the Lawes, with whom <hi>Feniſe</hi> grew familiar, finding their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations very pleaſant. Every one wakened his wit to finde matter to entertaine himſelfe. One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them propounded, that he would maintain that <hi>Denis</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Sicily</hi> was the moſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and courteous of all the Gentils of his time; another, that he would maintaine, that there was neither ingratitude nor ingratefull men in the World, and <hi>Feniſe</hi> offered to anſwer to all the problems and queſtions the others could make him. The two Italians begunne to diſcourſe upon the ſubjects propounded, where they brought ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and wel-grounded reaſons, that although they were ſophiſticall and falſe, they were capable to perſwade thoſe who did not truely underſtand them, but they uſed them rather to ſhew the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of their wits, then to have them believed. After they invited <hi>Feniſe</hi> to ſatisfie them in what he had promiſed; and as he was going to make them admire thoſe faire curioſities he had reaped by reading, the Pilot ſtayed him, in crying to the Saylors, that they ſhould fold up the ſayles; for they ſhould immediately have a great ſtorme. At
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54530:76"/>this fearfull advertiſement every one quit the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of theſe prophane diſcourſes, and begunne to looke to his conſcience, and to be troubled with the apprehenſion of ſhipwrack. They entered into the Gulfe of <hi>Leon,</hi> when Heaven begun to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a double obſcuritie, that of the night, and that of the ſtorme, wherein the windes were ſo violent, that they ſeemed to move the ſea unto the very bottome. In a little time the tempeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo furious, that all in the ſhip were fearefull; every one cryed out with a good heart for divine aſſiſtance, and demanded pardon for his faults. The Mariners themſelves were ſo amazed, that they knew not their compaſſe, nor what to doe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the cords, maſts, and ſailes were broken one from another; ſometimes the waves lifted up the ſhip to the clouds, and then again caſt it down into the moſt profound deeps: It thundered and hailed, and the aire produced lightning, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them but for to ſee things fearfull. In the end, after having ſuffered a long ſtorme, a wave caſt them againſt a Rock, where the ſhip was ſplit, and then ſome were buried quick in the waves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ranne to the laſt remedy of Shipwrack, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prolong their lives as long as they could, floating upon tables and packs: <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſeiſed upon a ſquare cheſt, wherein was his equipage, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned himſelfe to divine mercie, and to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericord of the waves. Heaven favourable to his vowes, would not let him ſerve for food to the ſea Monſters, but had care to conduct him; for after having felt all the evils that feare could cauſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout break of day, he ſaw himſelfe neare to ſhoare,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54530:76"/>which yet he could not come to, becauſe the waves ſeemed to ſport with him, ſometimes they made him almoſt to touch the land, and then caſt him much further off then he was before: In the end, having againe invoked divine aſſiſtance, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity wherein he was taught him to make uſe of his armes in ſtead of oares, he employed the laſt vigour of his courage, and tooke port betwixt two Rocks, kiſſing the ground, and giving God thankes for the miracle he had done in delivering him, and from this inſtant he accounted himſelfe a ſecond time borne into the world. The ſea grew calme, and the day by little and little grew light, and let him ſee the pittifull relicts of the Ship, and the ſpoiles of his companions, which floated upon the waters. He looked about him of all ſides to ſee if he could perceive the top of ſome Towre, or Steeple of ſome Towne or Village, that he might go thither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome ſuſtenance, but he ſaw nothing that could give him any hope of relief; he had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to recompence thoſe that ſhould aſſiſt him; for in this extreame misfortune he had reſting a good ſumme of money, which he had in gold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him and in his coffer, but at this time it was unſerviceable unto him. After he had conſulted what he ought to doe, he left the ſea ſhore, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turning back, as well to lament his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions who were drown'd, as for fear the ſea ſhould yet follow him to make him ſuffer the ſame ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; hee advanced into a field, not knowing whither he went, nor in what land he was; he heard, in approaching to a grove, a man lamenting, which ſpoke Spaniſh; then joy glided into his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54530:77"/>heart, thinking that he was arrived upon the coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and coming neare him by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he heard him ſpeake theſe words, Oh great God! the onely recourſe of afflicted ſoules, haſt thou reſolved to abandon me, amongſt theſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians for to finiſh here my daies, without enjoying that dear conſolation adminiſtred unto thoſe who are born under the knowledge of thy Lawes, and the true Religion? Lord thy will be done, if it bee thy pleaſure, I muſt reſolve to ſuffer it. Ending theſe laſt words, he gave a great ſigh, and held his peace, becauſe he had perceived our unfortunate Cavalier. <hi>Feniſe,</hi> who at firſt imagined himſelfe to be in <hi>Spaine</hi> his owne country, now learning the contrary by theſe words, converted his joy into ſadneſſe, preſuming that he was upon the coaſt of <hi>Barbary;</hi> he approached to him that complained, and thus ſaluted him; My friend, if you finde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgement to your troubles, in complaining to theſe trees, do not leave to continue, behold here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother infortunate, which may keep you company, and helpe you to weep, if you pleaſe, ſince that it ſeems by your language that we are of the ſame country: For me I am a Spaniard and native of <hi>Madrid.</hi> Oh God, anſwered the other, who was a venerable old man, a ſtrange encounter! And in embracing him with teares in his eyes; what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, continued he, or what divine power is it that hath conducted you hither? Then <hi>Feniſe</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him in what countrey hee was, and then told him of his Shipwrack, the moſt ſuccinctly that hee could; for he was ſo weak that he could ſcarcely ſpeak. After he prayed him to give him ſomething
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54530:77"/>to eat, and preſently <hi>Fredrikc,</hi> ſo was this old man called, prayed <hi>Feniſe</hi> to expect him amongſt the trees, and went in diligence to fetch him bread and drinke made of Lemmons and Sugar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Feniſe</hi> refreſhed himſelf. Having thus taken acquaintance one of the other, our Cavalier pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Fredric</hi> to tell him by what accident he came there, and was obliged to paſſe the reſt of his life in that barbarous region, as his complaints had let him underſtand. The old man deſiring to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the curioſitie of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> made him this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The illuſtrious towne where the Court of <hi>Spaine</hi> is ordinarily kept, is the place where I ſaw my firſt day, as well as you, if you be of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> as you ſay; I am of noble linage; yet I never ſaw my father, he being taken from me by a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſickneſs before I could have knowledge of him. He left me his onely heire and under the conduct of a mother, who neglected too much to keep in my youth, to which my riches gave mee more libertie than was reaſonable. Amongſt theſe liberties I made ſuch debauches, as I will not recount unto you; having been ſo exceſſive, that to compare that time with the life I lead now, I have cauſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme my ſelfe happy, although I am farre from it, and beſides it would augment your wearineſſe by a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54530:78"/>troubleſome attention. In this age my heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be warmed by love, by the perfections of a Gentlewoman of a great family, whoſe carriage was civility it ſelfe, and whoſe beauty was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which made all admire its author. It Would be ſuperfluous to tell you the arts, inventions, and ſubtilties I uſed to declare unto her my paſſion, and the paines I tooke to finde a favourable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to perſwade her to compaſſionate my torments; you may imagine them in repreſenting unto your ſelf that ſhe was the moſt recluſe of her time. You ſhall only know, that whatſoever ſervices or teſtimonies of fidelity I could render her for the ſpace of two years, it was impoſſible for me to hear one word from her mouth, to obtaine one favour from her hands, or to perceive any hopefull ſigne. In the end ſhe was overcome by my perſeverance, and not by her negligence; but who could reſiſt ſo long a purſuit without being an inſenſible rock? the ſtrongeſt places and Towers inacceſſible, have been gained rather by induſtry then valour: <hi>Troy, Numance,</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſerve us for examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; what marvaile was it then that adorable <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinde</hi> could alwayes reſiſt againſt the art, force, and courage wherewith I daily aſſaulted her? She was under the guard of a Mother, the moſt ſharp and auſtere woman that was in all <hi>Madrid: Perſinde</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much, that ſhe never looked upon her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trembling. Nevertheleſſe by ſucceſſion of time, and increaſing of obſtacles, our loves grew ſo great, that I obtained what I deſired. I ſaw <hi>Perſinde</hi> in her chamber by the intermiſſion of certain women her Governours, who often betray the honours of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54530:78"/>Maids, in making ſhew to defend them. In one word, our private meetings were ſo familiar, that within a few dayes <hi>Perſinde</hi> poſſeſſed a living gage of our affections. Love, that had made her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this fault, inſpired her with induſtry to hide it, and means to remedy it when it ſhould be time. She approached her term, when her Father had a fancy to ſend her to <hi>Toledo</hi> to ſee one of her Couſins which ſhe had there, and to recreate her ſelf with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſports which the Citizens then made. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinde</hi> diſcovered to her her ſecret as to her moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident friend, and after that, <hi>Agariſe</hi> (ſo was her Couſin called) had teſtified the diſpleaſure ſhe had for this accident; She promiſed to aſſiſt her in all ſhe could poſſible to avid the ſcandall; the ſeaſon being come of reaping that fruit into her hands, which had taken maturity in her womb, <hi>Agariſe</hi> writ to the Father and Mother of <hi>Perſinde,</hi> praying them to be pleaſed that ſhe might yet keep her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin with her, and that her leave might be prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome time, which they eaſily granted. I rendred my ſelf Burgois of <hi>Toledo</hi> the day of her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall, to the end to ſerve her, and contribute all that ſhould depend upon me to her aſſiſtance when there ſhould be occaſion; and for this cauſe I ſaw her almoſt every night in the preſence of her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. But one day, when <hi>Perſinde</hi> begun to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ordinary paines, her Couſin and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to leave the Town, and go to the Farms neer <hi>Toledo,</hi> which are called Cigarales, where <hi>Agariſe</hi> had acquainted a woman with this affaire, who was prepared to receive them when they ſhould come. But they were ſcarcely got half way when
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54530:79"/>violent paine ſeized poor <hi>Perſinde.</hi> Then <hi>Agariſe</hi> feigning another preſſing neceſſity, left the Coach with her, and retiring themſelves amongſt ſome buſhes which were happily there, <hi>Perſinde</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a Sonne, they wrapped him in linnens, and covered him with a little mantle of ſilke and gold which they had brought for that purpoſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking care to make haſt, then to trim up the Infant. This being done, <hi>Perſinde</hi> drew out of her pocket a paper, and having diligently blotted out all that was written therein, ſhewrit theſe few words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtian, this Infant demands Baptiſme, have a care thereof, and let him be called</hi> Louis. She hung this note about his neck with a ſilk ribband, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned him to celeſtiall mercy: They retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpeedily to their Coach, and without going further, returned to <hi>Toledo,</hi> feigning that <hi>Perſinde</hi> was ſick by the way: There was a great ſpace of time betwixt their return and the houre I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to viſit them, which was the cauſe of a misfortune, which maketh me yet ſigh. The night being come, I went to make mine ordinary viſit, where I learned this newes, and the place where I ſhould finde this poor little innocent. I depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in diligence, and ſought on all ſides with a torch; I viſited the inſide and outſide of every buſh that was in the place whither they had directed me, but without finding any thing. Feare ſeized my ſoule at the beginning, fearing that he was devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſome wild beaſt, and yet ſeeing no bloud ſpilt, nor any of the cloaths of the child, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that ſome charicable perſon, having heard it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54530:79"/>cry, had taken it away to give it a better lodging. After I had paſſed almoſt the whole night in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting three or four times the ſame place, to the end I might not be accuſed of negligence, I returned to <hi>Toledo,</hi> with intention to report otherwiſe to <hi>Perſinde,</hi> for fear of killing her with grief. The time of my going to ſee her being come, I made her believe that I had put the infant in a place of ſecurity, and that ſhe needed not further thinke therof. Not long after, <hi>Perſinde</hi> having recovered her colour, returned to <hi>Madrid,</hi> with letters from <hi>Agariſe</hi> her Couſin, which thanked her Unckle and Aunt for the honour ſhe had received from them in the viſit of her Couſin, let them know that ſhe had been a little ſick, ſo that all this affaire was happily overpaſſed, if the abſence of the child had not afflicted us.</p>
                  <p>My Mother deceaſed incontinently after this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and by her loſſe I remained in full liberty to match where I thought good. I then determined to demand <hi>Perſinde</hi> in marriage; but having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her therewith, ſhe counſelled me not to do it, for fear I ſhould thereby receive ſome diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, ſeeing that her Mother pretended to make her religious: And although ſhe knew not that <hi>Perſindes</hi> inclinations ſtood that way, yet ſhe uſed all poſſible diligence to make her condiſcend to her will. A great tyranny, to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by conſtraint take a condition againſt heart.</p>
                  <p>Having had certain advice of the intention of thi rigorous mother, and being aſſured of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons of? <hi>Perſinde,</hi> I ſtole her away one night, an
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54530:80"/>carried her to <hi>Cartagene,</hi> a towne ſcituate upon the ſea ſhore, and where the greateſt part of my eſtate was, I ſtayed with her there ſome yeares, we leading a very happy life. Heaven gave me another child, which was a daughter faire as an Angell, ſhe had all the features of her mother, but yet more ſweet and charming, I loved her above all things in the world, J could not be a moment without ſeeing her, and nothing pleaſed me ſo much as her innocence. She was about three yeares old when on a ſummers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening I had a great deſire to walke with her in a little place which I had neere the towne of <hi>Carta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene,</hi> and ſtay there untill the next day at the ſame houre; but I departed too late, for the night tooke me by the way. I held this little minion in mine armes, having taken her from her nurſe which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed her, and without thinking thereof I was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with a troope of pyrates, who tooke her with my heart out of mine armes, preſently I found my ſelfe in a veſſell companion to many ſlaves, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of my deere child and ſervants who were with me, and preſently after I found my ſelfe a captive in <hi>Algier</hi> which you ſee now. Conſider in what port you are arrived, and whether you had not better to have ſerved for food to ſea monſters, then to have falne into the hands of theſe earthly ones. I have languiſhed fourteene yeares in this miſery, where it ſeemes my life hath taken another nature, ſince that I dye not to avoid ſo many diſpleaſures. I have many times written to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and ſent my wife worde of my ſad diſafter, but what ever diligence I have uſed, I could never receive an anſwer. I doe not excuſe her of negligence, nor ill nature, I have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54530:80"/>too much proofe of her goodneſſe and vertue, but I thinke my letters never went ſo far, I feare that the King of <hi>Algier,</hi> who will not put my daughter nor me in the number of ſlaves to be ranſomed, hath ſtayed them, for theſe infidells are moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their ſoveraigne; ſo that I know not now if I have yet any body for me, nor whether my wife be in heaven or earth.</p>
                  <p>My daughter I have told you of, is called <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene;</hi> but the barbarian that raviſhed her from me, hath taken from her that name, and called her <hi>Cirife,</hi> at the end of ſix yeares of our captivitie, the pirate ſeeing day by day the beauty of this little one increaſe, made her ſerve him as an inſtrument to get the favour of <hi>Selin,</hi> King of <hi>Algier,</hi> he gave her to him to diſpoſe of her as he thought good. The Prince was much pleaſed with this preſent, and to teſtifie the eſteeme he had thereof, he promiſed to gratifie him upon all occaſions; when ſhe was taken out of mine armes her clothes were not ſo poore, but that they rendered her conſiderable, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed that ſhe was iſſued from chriſtians of great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which obliged the King to eſteeme her as much as if ſhe had beene his proper child. He hath brought her up like a queene, in effect I know he pretends to qualifie her with that greatneſſe and marry her. I apprehend, that that will be executed ſooner then is thought of, and ſo there may be a ſoule loſt, and a deſolation for mine old age.</p>
                  <p>The onely good that I have reſting amongſt ſo many diſpleaſures, is that I ſee her ſometimes, by a window of a Towre, where by good fortune, the King hath lodged her, the halfe of the circum fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54530:81"/>of this towre comes from the Kings lodgings againſt the gardens of the Citizens; having betwixt them but a little lane of five or ſix paces over, full of briers and buſhes. With diligent ſearching ſome meanes to approach this priſon, I have found a breach in a wall, which ſeemeth to have beene made for me by ſome angell: by it I goe to the foote of the tower, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hiding my ſelfe in the thornes and graſſe, I ſpeake ſometimes to <hi>Magdalene,</hi> whilſt ſhe maketh a ſhew to recreate her ſelfe in taking the ayre by the window, and by the veiw of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; In the little time we enjoy this common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, I ſpeake to her of no other thing, but that ſhe remember ſhe is a chriſtian, that ſhe take heede of violating her faith, whatſoever is offered her or ſaid to her, and that ſhe hope that God who never leaveth his, will receive our vowes, and one day give us the recompence of our travells and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie. See deere country man the ſubject of my afflictions and miſerie, which you may helpe me to lament as you told me at your arrivall, if peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you have not particulars, which oblige you to imploy your teares for your ſelfe; and if it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the loſſe you have made of your libertie, you will not want cauſe of teares Alas! there is ſo long a death prepared for you amongſt chaines and travells, that I aſſure my ſelfe that you will be ſorry you were not buried in the waters as your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which I eſteeme much happier then your ſelf. Hitherto <hi>Feniſe</hi> had harkened to the afflictions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but from that moment he begun to feare thoſe that threatened him: but when the courage is firme, there is no adverſitie that can aſtoniſh a man,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54530:81"/>nor danger capable to terrifie him. <hi>Feniſe</hi> having a while conſidered the finiſtre predictions of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and ſtudied by what induſtry he might prevent theſe future diſgraces, he made him this diſcourſe. In harkening to the recitall you have made me of your misfortunes, I have conceived in my minde what may remedy you, and it may be you will judg ſo, when I have communicated it unto you. But to oblige you the more to ſecond my intentions, I wil tell you newes of the child you went to ſearch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the buſhes neere <hi>Toledo.</hi> He was named <hi>Louis</hi> as his mother deſired, I have not onely knowne him, but that knowledge is paſſed into an affection, he is one of my intimate friends. I have left him at <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> at a gentlemans houſe a friend of mine, called <hi>Leonard,</hi> in whoſe houſe he hath recounted to me his whole life, whoſe beginning anſwers to all the particulars you have told me thereof. A labourer found him in the place where you went to ſeek him, he had care to bring him up, and entertaine him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his deceaſe; and in making him inheritour of all his eſtate, he gave him a little purſe, wherein was the paper that you ſaw his mother hung about his neck, which he yet carefully keepeth. So great a tranſport of joy ſeized the heart of <hi>Frederick,</hi> that he wanted not much of falling at the feet of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> when when he told this newes: But after a little ſilence, it is poſſible ſaid he, that my ſtars begin to be weary with perſecuting me, what will heaven give me this contentment in my laſt dayes and aſſure me that my child liveth? Alas! if I could perſwade my ſelfe as you ſay, I ſhould no longer eſteeme my ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, although I be a ſlave and charged with chaines. Yet you give me ſo many markes thereof
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54530:82"/>and your manner of ſpeaking hath ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of truth, that I willingly believe it. For that which concerneth the propoſition you make to execute a deſigne which may produce ſome happy ſucceſſe; doe not doubt my fidelity; I ingage to you my faith to expoſe my ſelfe to all ſortes of hazards, to ſerve you untill the loſſe of my life if there be neede, aſſuring my ſelfe, that before any thing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken you will judge that it is all that a ſlave can offer. Doe not believe anſwered <hi>Feniſe,</hi> that I make ſo little eſteeme thereof, as onely to hazard it; on the contrary the induſtry I have adviſed my ſelfe of, tends onely to its conſervation and ſafety. I can ſpeake the <hi>Arabick</hi> language in perfection, having learned it of a ſlave of my fathers, by a ſecret provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of heaven, who foreſaw this preſent neceſſitie. With that I have ſome money which is ſaved with me from the paſſed ſhipwrack. I put it into my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome when I entered into the ſhip at <hi>Livorne.</hi> My deſigne is, to buy by your meanes a turkiſh habit, and cloth my ſelfe therein: I will ſay that I am Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of <hi>Fez,</hi> and will buy you of your maſter; when you ſhall be out of your captivitie you ſhall alſo change your clothes, and by the favour of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique language, wee will ſave our ſelves as well as we can poſſibly. By this meanes you ſhall be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the miſeries wherein you are, you will give a new life to your wife, and ſee him for whom you both have ſhed ſo many tears. I believe anſwered <hi>Frederick,</hi> that heaven hath expreſſely preſerved you from ſhipwrack, to deliver me from the miſeries wherein I am, this encounter could not have beene without the ſoveraigne appointment of God. There
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54530:82"/>are many circumſtances which may helpe the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your project: this day they ſolemnize the nativity of my maſter, who is a <hi>Bacha,</hi> the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after the King, and his favourite; and becauſe of this feaſt, wee ſlaves have more libertie then upon other dayes, every one maketh holiday, and is at reſt, therefore you have found me here aſide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining my diſaſter, beſides becauſe I belong to this ſeignieur; wee have a little more priviledge then other captives, the guards that are at the gates take not ſo much heede of us, ſo that all theſe things being conſidered I hope to ſatisfie you in what you deſire to our common contentment. <hi>Feniſe</hi> at the ſame time gave him as much money as was neceſſary for that purpoſe, &amp; in the meane while he remained hidden in an old great hollow oake, which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med yeares had prepared for this act of hoſpitalitie. <hi>Frederick</hi> was not long in returning with ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits as he judged moſt proper for their deſigne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcharged of his pacquet, <hi>Feniſe</hi> told him that he had left a box upon the ſea ſhore, wherein was a part of his equipage, and upon the which he had ſaved himſelfe, and having conſulted together what was to be done, they went to ſeeke it, bringing it with much paine, and burying it in a remarquable place, to have recourſe to it if there ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Then without loſing time <hi>Feniſe</hi> tooke the turbant and other Turkiſh habits, put a Cimiter by his ſide, and diſguiſed himſelfe ſo properly, that the moſt ſubtill <hi>Turk</hi> would have taken him for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall countryman. The ſame day a Merchante ſhip a Jew landed at <hi>Algier</hi> laden with great riches, as Velvets, Scarlets, Spaniſh clothes, and other rare
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54530:83"/>Merchandiſes of <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Caire,</hi> whither they make great traffique, this happened well for <hi>Feniſe;</hi> for at the houre that it arrived, which was towards the evening, he and <hi>Frederick</hi> approached near the gates of the Town, and our Cavalier mingled himſelf amongſt the new comers, and was taken by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens for a Merchant, and by the Merchants for one of the towne, ſo that he entred freely without any one taking notice of him. <hi>Frederick</hi> ſerved him for guide and Harbinger, finding him lodging for his mony where <hi>Fredrick</hi> left him, having before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved together, that <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſhould goe the next day to his Maſter to treat about his ranſome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſlept but very little that night, his minde was buſied with a thouſand ſeverall thoughts, one while he conſidered the danger which he had run and from which he had been ſaved, to fall into the hands of Barbarians; another while he thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſcourſe <hi>Frederick</hi> had made him, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that his daughter muſt needs be rarely faire, ſince that the King of <hi>Algier</hi> pretended to marry her, and as he occupyed his ſpirit in this entertaine, he grew extreamly deſirous to ſee this beauty when he ſhould have delivered the father: The day being come, he informed himſelfe where the <hi>Bacha's</hi> houſe was, where <hi>Frederick</hi> was ſlave, he was conducted thither, and being arrived at the gate, he courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly demanded to ſpeake to him, ſaying he would buy one of his ſlaves. He was brought before the <hi>Bacha,</hi> and when they were face to face, they were both mute, and without motion as ſtatues. <hi>Feniſe</hi> knew that this was his fathers ſlave which had taught him the Arabique Language, which was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54530:83"/>called <hi>Mahomet Zeran,</hi> and reſpected as <hi>Bacha,</hi> and the greateſt favourite of the King of <hi>Algier. Feniſe</hi> was then ſorry that hee had preſented himſelfe in perſon to treate upon the liberty of <hi>Frederick</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving meanes to have done it otherwiſe, but diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the extreame confuſion he was in, for feare of being diſcovered, he broke ſilence, and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what he demanded. Before <hi>Mahomet</hi> anſwered him, he asked him what he was, of what country, and how he was called, faigning to believe he was a a Turke, although he knew him well enough. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi> being reaſsured, boldly anſwered him in the <hi>African</hi> language, that he was a Turke of an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious family and native of <hi>Fez,</hi> and come to ſeeke Sanctuary near him, flying the cruelty of two brothers, which would have killed him, and that he was called <hi>Gomhor; Mahomet</hi> admired the wit and carriage of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> who diſguiſed the truth with ſuch art; but without playing further with him, he came to him and told him in his eare in Spaniſh, whatſoever cauſe hath brought you hither, you are welcome; in ſaying ſo, he tooke him by the hand, and made him ſit downe by him, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which he did to no body. <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſaw by his proceeding and language, that hee knew him: And <hi>Mahomet</hi> continuing to ſpeak, <hi>Feniſe,</hi> ſaid he, you little eſteem the ſincerity of my heart, ſince you uſe ſo much art to diſguiſe a truth ſo evident. I am ſorry you hinder me ſo long from perfectly enjoying the joy I have to ſee you in a place where I have power to ſerve you, and teſtifie by ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the ſenſible obligations I have to you and your father, whom I ſhall reſpect all my life, as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54530:84"/>mine owne, ſaying ſo he caſt himſelfe, upon <hi>Feniſe</hi> his neck and ſtraightly imbraced him. Our Cavalier touched with theſe ſingular proofes of the good nature of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was conſtrained to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yeeld to his courteſie, he bowed himſelfe very low, and embraced his knees, and by the moſt civill complements his good wit could invent, made him underſtand, that reſpect had engaged him to this diſſimulation, and as he was about to explicate his reaſons, <hi>Mahomet</hi> made a ſigne with his eye, that he ſhould hold his peace. All that ſaw their actions, knew not what to thinke thereof, principally that <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould ſhew himſelfe ſo affable towards this man, who was accuſtomed to be ſevere towards them. The <hi>Bacha</hi> would not that they ſhould know more, commanded them to retire, and leave them alone, as they did, and then <hi>Feniſe</hi> having rendered him a thouſand teſtimonies of his joy, briefly told him all the hiſtory of his life, ſince he had left <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> untill this happy encounter. <hi>Mahomet</hi> full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment and admiration with the recitall of theſe ſtrange misfortunes, promiſed to employ all his wealth and credit for his contentment, and to furniſh him with means to return into <hi>Spaine,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt occaſion that ſhould be offered; after having learned that <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſlave he demanded to buy, was father to one of his intimate friends, he gave him to him to doe with him what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; then he invited him to lodge in his houſe, but <hi>Feniſe</hi> excuſed himſelfe therefrom, judging that that might hinder the effect of his intentions; yet he could not defend himſelf from ſtaying dinner with him. They begun to ſpread upon the ground
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54530:84"/>a great piece of Tapiſtry, upon which they dined. Then he was obliged to receive the viſit of a Turk of quality who came to ſpeak to him about an affair of importance, which cauſed <hi>Feniſe</hi> to retire himſelf into an Anti-chamber, to let them deviſe more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together. He walked there, and thanked God that <hi>Mahomet</hi> had treated him ſo humanely; and as he was upon theſe thoughts, he ſaw a little doore open into the Anti-chamber where he was, out of which came a faire Moore, richly habited, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be melancholique. Our Cavalier ſaluted her with an action full of reſpect and humility. The Moore made him a reverence after the mode of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereat <hi>Feniſe</hi> was aſtoniſhed, but yet more, when ſhe approached him, ſaying in the Spaniſh tongue.</p>

                  <p>CAvalier, ſaid ſhe, with a deep ſigh, I have heard all the recitall of the hiſtory you told to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> wherein by having named <hi>Leonard,</hi> a high Cavalier of the town of <hi>Valence,</hi> you have moved my memory to diſcourſe upon the misfortunes of my life, and obliged my reaſon to acknowledge the faults which my impudence hath made me commit, from whence I ſuffer a moſt rigorous unquietneſſe of ſpirit. I am the unfortunate <hi>Eufemie,</hi> I am that unhappy cauſe of the troubles of <hi>Leonard</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54530:85"/>having preferred my ſenſuall pleaſures before the duties of my birth and qualitie: I will not cloake my miſcarriages, though love might render them excuſable; on the contrary, I deſire to make you a naked deſcription thereof, yet as ſhort as I can poſſible, whilſt the abſence of <hi>Mahomet</hi> giveth me leiſure, that by mine own ſhame, I may in your perſon render ſome ſatisfaction to my brother, ſince you ſay you are his friend.</p>
                  <p>I loved paſſionately a Cavalier, which you have known from the mouth of my brother, as your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes have given me cauſe to preſume; but ſo paſſionately that I left my houſe to follow him, he carried me to <hi>Madrid</hi> (I ought to hide my face, in telling you the infamous commerce that that man made me doe) where he rendered mee a publique Courtizan, not ſo much to ſatisfie his neceſſity, as the vengeance he would take of my brother in my perſon and honour. From <hi>Madrid,</hi> for to ſave our ſelves from my brother who had diſcovered us, wee went to <hi>Saragoce,</hi> where wee ſtayed ſome moneths, and there I had the reputation of the moſt faire and famous Courtezan of that age, and as ſuch a one was viſited by the greateſt Gallants of the towne. During our ſtay there, <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> which you know to be the name of the cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of my brother, and my renowne, made friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with a young Gentleman, whoſe merits were were cheriſhed and eſteemed by a moſt noble Lady of an excellent wit and beauty, and the better to expreſſe her perfections, I pray you conſider, that they muſt needs be rare, ſince that being of my ſex, and the originall of my misfortunes, I am yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to praiſe her.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo was this Cavalier called which ſhe loved, diſcovered part of the ſecrets of his ſoule, and amongſt others that of his flame to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> his new friend. I may well ſay he gave him part of his fire, ſince that he rendered him taken with the love of <hi>Cerinthe,</hi> ſhe was called ſo, nevertheleſſe durſt not enterpriſe to declare unto her his feeling for feare <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be offended therewith; and to avoide this inconvenience, he betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to art, in all occaſion wherein I was ſpoke of in the preſence of <hi>Alexander, Don Pedro</hi> ſpoke mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells of me, as if I had beene the moſt accompliſhed with beauty, wit, and merit, to the end to move him to love me, and oblige him to breake that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall band of amity that was vowed betwixt them, and thereby to imitate him and make <hi>Cerinthe</hi> his miſtreſſe alſo to change. In a word he conducted his deſigne ſo cunningly, that it tooke as he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Alexander</hi> courted me, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content therewith, and to revenge himſelfe, got ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe neere <hi>Cerinthe,</hi> which he found eaſy enough at the beginning: there is no woman that is offended with being beloved, and ſhe that doth not diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the ſervice of a lover, beginneth already to love. <hi>Alexander</hi> taken with this new affection, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirred from my lodging, neglecting by this meanes to viſit <hi>Cerinthe,</hi> and ſhe knowing his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy rendered him the like, making love with <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> By ſucceſſion of time <hi>Alexanders</hi> father was advertiſed of his debauches, he was told that his ſonne entertained a courtezan a ſtranger which coſt him much. And foraſmuch as old people are covetous, and forget the follies of their youthes, he could
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54530:86"/>not excuſe this of his ſonnes. He employed his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſo well, that the Juſtice commanded me to quit the towne in a certaine time. I ſeeing my ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to obey, gave notice thereof to <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> but inſtead of being ſorry for it, he ſeemed to be very well pleaſed with this newes, becauſe my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence gave him more libertie to paſſe his time with <hi>Cerinthe,</hi> ſo that one day he told me that I might goe whither I would, and that he could not then leave <hi>Sarragoſe.</hi> I ſeeing my ſelfe ſo unworthily uſed by this perfidious, and conſidering the reſolution which he tooke to abandon me, being diſtaſted with my perſon, I imagined he loved elſe where: in this opinion I uſed ſuch exact diligence; that I diſcovered the cauſe of his diſdaine, as I have now told you. I did not leave to require his aſſiſtance in this neceſſitie, adding imbracements to words, and repreſenting unto him the obligations which he had to me, yea imploying ſome times, threats; for my jelouſie and his contempt carryed me to furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extreamities. In the end either by reaſons or fear I made him reſolve to quit <hi>Sarragoce,</hi> and leave <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthe,</hi> but with deſigne to revenge himſelfe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly of my perſecutions, as I have ſince learned. He deferred our departure as long as he could poſſible, and ſtayed untill the very laſt day the Juſtice had given me for that effect. In the end wee tooke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the way to <hi>Valence,</hi> he did nothing but curſe by the way, there came nothing out of his mouth but inſolencies, injuries, and threatenings; he drew his poynard and preſented it unto me, then he put it againe into the ſcabbard; in briefe he ſo affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that every moment I believed he was about
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54530:86"/>to open my breaſt and pull out my heart, he ſeemed to be ſo full of fury &amp; rage: being arrived at our firſt Inne, it was impoſſible for me to take any foode. I went to bed weeping bitterly for my faults, and endeavouring to invent ſome way to deliver my ſelfe from this traytor: the next morning he preſſed me to be gone on our voyage, and I, fearing he would put me to ſome tragique end, fained to be ſick, and prayed him to defer it one day, which he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the ſolicitation of the hoſt and hoſteſſe who had pitty of me ſeeing me weepe, but it was not without many curſes. Heaven which deſires not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the loſſe of thoſe that offend it, which lets them live to amend and repent, yea and aſſiſts them to oblige them the more to acknowledge it in the midſt of their extreame neceſſities, conducted <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> to the ſame Inne where we were. And becauſe he arrived at a time when <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was gone to walke by the ſide of a little river, which was neere thereunto, not being able to ſtay in my company, I had leaſure to conſider his faſhion and behaviour: I ſaw he had a good countenance that he was of a proportion big and ſtrong; and joyning to theſe circumſtances that he was well mounted, and very well habited, I tooke him for a gentleman or a man of honour; In this thought without knowing him to be an infidell and no chriſtian, I went to aske his aſſiſtance. I ſuccinctly told him my hiſtory, and the extreame trouble I was in, beſeeching him, ſince that he went the ſame way, to follow us unto the firſt towne, without loſing ſight of us to hinder that my perfidious conductor might not doe me ſome diſpleaſure. <hi>Mahomet</hi> having conſidered my
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54530:87"/>language &amp; countenance, had his heart touched with compaſſion as he hath ſince told me and promiſed me very courteouſly, to ſatisfie al that I could deſire from his ſervice; with this aſſurance, I told <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> that I was ready to depart when he would, he tooke me at my word, and about two houres before ſun ſetting, we left this lodging following on our way. At the beginning of the night we arrived at the entry of a wood; then I looked behind me and perceived <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had not yet appeared, which a little moderated my feare. We were ſcarcely in this wood when I knew that we had left the great way, and that we were in a little path, we are out of the way cryed I to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> no, no, anſwered he, follow me; it is the neareſt for our journey. I who was in perpetuall diſtruſt, believed theſe words were equivocall, and that the neareſt which he meant, was to finde the iſſue of my life. I turned my ſelfe yet once, and ſaw my defendor follow us, I tooke cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and a little time after <hi>Son Pedro</hi> turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. You are in the right ſaid he; I believe we are out of the way, and ſince that there is no way more here, let us light. What neede is there of that ſaid I. Away, away we muſt, replyed he with a tone extraordinary. I will take here the laſt vengeance of the hatred I beare to thy blood and perſon which hath rendered it ſelf too odious to mine eyes by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting my pleaſures; ſaying ſo, he tooke his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard in his hand, and attempted to ſtrike me down from the Mule whereupon I was mounted; ſeeing the rage of this action, and the glittering of the iron, wherewith be would have ſacrificed me to his felony; I cried out, Ah cruell, what thinkeſt thou
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54530:87"/>to doe? and endeavoured to ſtay his arme, or at leaſt to ſlacken the blow. At the ſame time I was ſuccoured by valiant <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who came running with his ſword in his hand, crying, Traytor what wilt thou doe? Mine enemy ſeeing the ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of this protector, knew not if it was not an angell in the figure of a man; yet he drew his ſword to defend his life, but the other aſſailed him ſo furiouſly, that his endeavours were unprofitable, he made him give up his ſoule in the ſame place where he thought to have murdered me. At the echo of theſe clamours and my lamentings, an unknown man came in, it may bee with deſigne to ſuccour thoſe he heard complaine, but <hi>Mahomet</hi> tooke a piſtoll which was at, his ſaddle bow, prayed this unknown to paſſe no further, and to ſuffer him to goe without further informing himſelfe of any thing. I am much deceived if you bee not he of whom I ſpeak, the diſcourſe which I heard you hold to <hi>Mahomet</hi> giveth mee a great preſumption thereof. We took our horſes, and went towards the towne of <hi>Tortoſe,</hi> I ſaw I ought my life to this Cavalier, and for that reaſon it ſeemed to me I was obliged to follow him whither he would lead me; without knowing either his nation or religion; I took him for a Spaniard, becauſe he ſpoke the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage perfectly well. Coming neare <hi>Tortoſe,</hi> he told me, that he did not thinke it expedient for us to goe thither, for feare of ſome ill ſucceſſe, becauſe of the homicide committed; ſo that turning out of the right way, he carried me to a <hi>Bourge</hi> near to the ſea ſhoare, and in a place called the neck of <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouer,</hi> where are little armes, where the Moores
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54530:88"/>hide themſelves, and from whence they make ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and courſes upon the Chriſtian countries. In fine, whether he had notice to be there, or that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune conducted him thither, he found a Galley of Pirats, whereof the chiefe came with great reſpect to ſpeak to him, and upon the inſtant they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves to return. Then <hi>Mahomet</hi> let mee know, that hee intended to carry me along with him, he declared unto me his country, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſweeteſt entertainment that I could hope for amongſt my Kindred. I ſeeing my ſelfe obliged to ſatisfie him either by fair means or conſtraint, I heaved up my ſhoulders, and teſtified to him a ſilent conſentment, though it was not without ſhedding many teares, and making many ſobs, conſidering to what misfortune my faults would engage me, as amongſt others to goe finiſh the reſt of my daies amongſt barbarian infidels, far from the exerciſe of the chriſtian faith, being altogether abandoned to the mercy of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> I eſteemed my ſelf as his ſlave; but although he was of a barbarous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet hee was of ſo courteous a nature, that he uſed me with all the reſpect he could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly render to a Lady to whom he was inferior. He ſaw well that I had cauſe to weep and afflict my ſelf as I did, therefore he uſed no violence, to make me forget my diſgraces, he onely attempted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my troubles, with much modeſtie and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In briefe conſidering the extreame miſery whereunto my ſtars had reduced me, I might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme my ſelfe very happy; for there are diſaſters, which ought to bee eſteemed as felicities, when one knoweth they have been in danger to ſuffer greater. One day during our navigation, hee related unto
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54530:88"/>me the nobleneſſe of his extraction, the courſes which he had made upon the Chriſtians, that in the ſame Gally where we were he had been made a ſlave, and ſold to a Spaniſh Gentleman of the towne of <hi>Madrid,</hi> who finding himſelfe beholden to him for great ſervices he had done him in a certain quarrel, and that ſeeing he would not turn Chriſtian, had given him his liberty with money and a good horſe, for to returne into his countrie, having before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed him like a Spaniard to the end he might paſſe more ſecurely, and not be knowne what hee was. And this was the cauſe that I demanded his aſſiſtance, believing him by his habits to be a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of our nation. Having much lamented my misfortunes. I muſt reſolve to have patience, and referre all to divine mercy, in comforting my ſelfe that I am falne into the hands of a man of excellent behaviour which he learned in <hi>Caſtile.</hi> We arrived in this town, where being received by his father with open armes, and cheriſhed by the King, he is now his onely favourite. I hold the ſame place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he loveth me with paſſion, as being as he ſaith, the onely pleaſure of his life; he hath never ſpoken to me to change my religion, for hee beleeveth that ought to come voluntarily without any force or reſtraint. The contentments which hee giveth mee, and the care he hath to ſee me ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are ſo great, that there are but two things which trouble me, the profeſsion of my faith, and my dear Country, without that there is no felicity in the world that can be entire. The reception he hath made of you accompanied with ſo many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours teſtifie, that he eſteemeth you much. I have
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54530:89"/>often heard him ſpeake of you before your arrivall, as of a Gentleman moſt accompliſhed; therefore you may aſſure your ſelfe of his amitie, and believe that he will employ himſelfe in all occaſions where you ſhall have need of his credit, and alſo for your returne into <hi>Spaine</hi> when you ſhall deſire it. If I could but follow you, and that you would but carry me thither with you, I aſſure my ſelfe you would have cauſe to commend the acknowledgment my brother and I ſhould make you for it. <hi>Feniſe</hi> was about to anſwer her, but upon the inſtant a ſervant came to advertiſe them, that the Bacha their Lord was coming thither, which obliged him to attend another occaſion. <hi>Euſemie</hi> retired into her chamber by the ſame door ſhee came, which ſhee ſhut as before; and leaving <hi>Feniſe</hi> in great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, made him know in the end, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> and ſhe had been the cauſe of the pains which hee had ſuffered, having been like to have loſt his life ſhamefully, being accuſed for killing <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and kept priſoner for that ſubject. <hi>Mahomet</hi> excuſed himſelf to <hi>Feniſe</hi> for having left him ſo long alone; <hi>Feniſe</hi> replyed by thoſe civilities which are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily uſed in ſuch complements, then they continued to ſpeake of times paſſed, wherein they both tooke great pleaſure. Thereupon they came to tell them that dinner was ready, where the ſtranger was magnificently treated after the faſhion of the country. In the interim <hi>Mahomet</hi> made a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to be prepared for him in the towne, ſending all things neceſſary for a houſhold. The evening being come, he was carried to take poſſeſſion of his houſe, whereof he remained abſolute maſter.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:54530:89"/>
                  <p>Here one may finde occaſion to marvell at the inconſtancy of things, and the ſtrange mutation of fortune. It is not Long ſince <hi>Feniſe</hi> was toſſed by the fury of contrary windes, and at the preſent he hath the winde of favour in poape, not long ſince he was tumbled and tormented in a ſhip, and now he is courteouſly received in a Palace, yeſterday he was naked, and to day clothed with rich orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yeſterday in a ſtorme at ſea, and to day ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured upon earth, yeſterday fearing to be made a ſlave, and to day poſſeſſing the graces and favours of a prince. He had an extreame paſſion to ſee the daughter of <hi>Frederick,</hi> which we call <hi>Magdalene,</hi> as well becauſe it was her proper name, as alſo being more pleaſant to the eare then that of <hi>Catife,</hi> which they had given her at <hi>Algier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> was become amorous of her, without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, but by the ſimple relation of her beauties, which he had heard her Father make. He dyed with impatience to attaine to this pleaſant viſion. But foraſmuch as the paſſions of love are wounds that reach to the very bottome of the breaſt, they muſt have a long time to be cured, ſo that to think to arrive at the end without paſſing by the middle, is either a thing impoſſible, or very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo that his diſcretion was willing to give leaſure to time to work with her, without uſing violence.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Feniſe</hi> renewed his acquaintance with the <hi>Bacha Mahomet,</hi> and received his favours. <hi>Frederick</hi> raviſhed with joy for the happy encounter he had made, and the faire hopes which were given him, would carry newes thereof to his daughter, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54530:90"/>ſhe might partake in his contentment, but he found the breach of the wall made up, and his paſſage ſtopped; the owner of this Garden had repaired this breach it may bee for his proper commodity, or it may be becauſe he had ſeen him paſſe that way. Seeing himſelfe thus deprived of this little good that reſted to him, he begunne againe to lament his misfortunes, and with teares in his eyes, came to ſeeke his conſolation in the wits of generous <hi>Feniſe.</hi> His dwelling was not now where he had lodged, he paſſeſſed the houſe which <hi>Mahomet</hi> had made to be accommodated for him. He received him there with the moſt courteous welcome that was poſſible, and told him that he had obtained his libertie, having let <hi>Mahomet</hi> know that he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to one of his moſt intimate friends, and from that hour he retained him to dwell with him, in expecting ſome meanes for the deliverance of his daughter <hi>Magdelene. Frederick</hi> embraced him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new with a thouſand thankes, for the affection which he had teſtified to him: But <hi>Feniſe</hi> obſerved the ſadneſſe which he had in his countenance, and asked him the cauſe thereof. Then <hi>Frederick</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto him that his laſt conſolation was taken from him, the place being ſtopped by which he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee his daughter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> having known the cauſe of his diſpleaſure, led him into a Gallery which was on the back ſide of his lodging from whence one might ſee the Kings houſe on that ſide the tower was, which was over againſt it, and in ſhewing it to him, he ſayd, If that be the tovver vvhereof you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to me, you need not ſo much deſpaire as you
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54530:90"/>doe. Alas, it is the ſame anſwered <hi>Frederick,</hi> but the diſtance from hence thither, is too great to ſpeak to her, if we had occaſion to give her advice of any thing, yet we are happy replyed <hi>Feniſe,</hi> that we are no further from it, but that from the one place to the other we may eaſily know and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the features of the face; let us then content our ſelves with what it pleaſeth heaven to give us, perhaps it will furniſh us with ſome invention from whence we may draw more benefit then we can imagine. <hi>Frederick</hi> ſuffered himſelfe to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this conſolation, and determined to keep watch in this Gallery, looking every moment if <hi>Magdelene</hi> or the Chriſtian ſlave which ſerved her ſhould come to the window. But becauſe ſhe had there preſented her ſelfe three or four times, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing <hi>Frederick,</hi> because of the accident that was happened, ſhe made no more account to appear there, judging that there was ſome great impediment happened to their felicity.</p>
                  <p>This opinion was the cauſe that <hi>Frederick</hi> paſſed a whole week in meaſuring the length of this Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and counting the minutes of every day. In the end as he was deploring his miſery, being out of all hope of ever ſeeing againe his dear daughter; for the laſt time he caſt his eyes upon the window, and ſaw <hi>Magdelene</hi> and her ſlave, who looked upon him conteſting together whether it was he or no; for the unknown houſe and gallery where he was, put them in this doubt. Then <hi>Frederick</hi> lifting up his eyes to heaven in action of thankfulneſſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his armes towards her, leaning over the parapet made himſelf known, and put them out of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54530:91"/>doubt. He let them underſtand as well as he could by his actions why he could come no more to the foot of the Tower, and that from thenceforwards he might ſee her from the place where he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dwelt there, and was no longer ſlave; then after a little time, <hi>Magdalene</hi> made to him the ſigne of farewell untill the next day, and ſhut her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for fear of abuſing the favours of fortune, or that <hi>Selin</hi> ſhould perceive them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> at that time ſtirred not from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and entertaining his affections, and when the night obliged him to retreat, <hi>Frederick</hi> made him the recitall of what he had ſeen, and that he hoped to have the ſame contentment the next day: That he thought it would not be amiſs to make <hi>Magdalen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was her Brother of whom he had many times ſpoken to her, to the end ſhe might preſent her ſelf more freely. Our Cavalier found this no ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, becauſe it ſuted to his deſires; he told him he ſhould abſolutely diſpoſe of his perſon and life: But dear <hi>Frederick</hi> (ſaid he) when a man enterpriſeth an affaire, difficult, dangerous, and ſerious, he ought to foreſee all the inconveniences imaginable, which may hinder his deſign, for to attempt to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount them, and come to a happy ſucceſſe. We muſt then goe here with great warineſſe, and take exact heed to our ſelves in the beginning, for feare of failing in the end. You ſaid (as I remember) that <hi>Magdalene</hi> is ſo recluſe, and retired, that no one ſeeth her but the King, and from thence I fear that ſhe will not ſhew her ſelf, ſeeing me with you, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that I am ſome Turk; but to warrant us from this danger, I think it fit to change my habits, I
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54530:91"/>have found an invention to get the box brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which we buried at the entry of the forreſt, where I found you after my ſhipwrack; I will take an habit that is therein, and then when <hi>Magdalen</hi> ſhall ſee me clothed after the Spaniſh faſhion, you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſwade her that I am her Brother. <hi>Frederick</hi> approved of his opinion, and <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſhewed him a ſuit made for the Country, of gray cloth, covered with plate lace of gold and ſilver, and compleat with all other furniture. The day being come, ſo impatiently expected by theſe two friends. <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> ſet himſelf upon the watch in the Gallery, and not long after ſaw the window open, and <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and her ſlave appear. He made her a ſign to ſtay, and went to fetch <hi>Feniſe</hi> to let him ſee his daughter; he came, he ſaw, and was overcome; the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he had formed to himſelf of the beauties of <hi>Magdalen</hi> was very imperfect in compariſon of the originall which he admired. During his raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Magdalen</hi> carefully conſidered him, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this new faſhion of habit, and with the grace and good countenance which he had, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing who he was.</p>
                  <p>Her ſpirit was much troubled to explicate this Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigma; but in the end, her father forced her by imbracements and other ſignes to comprehend that it was her Brother. She underſtood it, and then her admiration was converted into confuſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to divine by what meanes he was come into that place, for ſhe had learned of her Father the Hiſtory of his birth and loſſe. <hi>Feniſe</hi> made all the geſture? of reſpect and love he could deviſe, to teſtifie to her that he was not only her Brother, but
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54530:92"/>her ſlave and defendor; ſhe rendred him thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences and ſalutations which courteſie obliged her to, teſtifying with her armes, that ſhe imbraced him with her heart. Whilſt <hi>Magdelen</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> entertained themſelvs with theſe mute complements, <hi>Erimene</hi> attentively conſidered our Cavalier, this was the name that this Chriſtian ſlave had taken to diſguiſe her own; by much regarding him, ſhe thought ſhe knew him, and well remembring her ſelf, ſhe remembred his name, and the place where ſhe had ſeen him. She judged, that ſince they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give an impreſſion to her Miſtreſſe that this was her Brother, it was not neceſſary to declare to her what ſhe knew, for fear of breaking ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable project to the contentment of her Father, ſhe reſolved to keep ſilence, and ſee to what end would come all theſe confuſions. In the interim it was not permitted them to ſtay any longer in the preſence one of another. <hi>Erimene</hi> carefull to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage occaſion, made ſigne to <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> to retire, yet adviſing the old man to be at the ſame place two hours after, and when the Sun was neer ſetting, <hi>Magdelen</hi> made them the ſign of adieu, and ſhut her window, leaving our Cavalier more captive then all the ſlaves in <hi>Barbary,</hi> having ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to her at the very inſtant of his firſt regard, his liberty, heart, and life, reſolved to hazard all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver her from the ſubjection wherein ſhe was. He returned to change his habits, and take thoſe of a Turk to go viſit <hi>Mahomet.</hi> He was very carefull to conſerve his good will, and obſerve him in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, that he might make uſe of his credit if there ſhould be occaſion thereof, although he had
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54530:92"/>declared nothing to him of his deſign, nor of the intelligence he had with <hi>Frederick,</hi> for fear his zeale to ſerve the King might ſurmount the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which he bore him. He knew ſo well how to make uſe of the favours of this Moor that he made him believe he took no care to return into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that after ſo many misfortunes received there, he would renounce it, and was determined to ſtay there with him as long as he ſhould pleaſe. <hi>Mahomet</hi> finding himſelf obliged to his affection, would teſtifie the eſteem that he made thereof, by inſtalling him in the charge of <hi>Subbacha,</hi> (an office of juſtice, as one may ſay Corrector, or Judge of politick Government) which <hi>Feniſe</hi> willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ſeeing it was an excellent meanes to bring about his deſign, ſeeing that this charge made him be feared of the people, eſteemed by the Nobles, and generally beloved and reſpected of all. The night begun to extend it ſelf upon the face of the Earth, when venerable <hi>Frederick</hi> rendred himſelf in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and ſaw immediatly the window open, and <hi>Erimene</hi> appear, holding a bow and arrow, which ſhe ſhot againſt a wall, a little further off then the place where he was, making a ſigne to him that he ſhould take it up. <hi>Erimene</hi> having ſeen him doe what ſhe deſired, departed, and ſhut the window. <hi>Frederick</hi> perceived that this arrow had a little paper rouled about the end thereof, inſtead of a pile, and induſtriouſly accommodated; he judged that there was ſome myſtery hidden; he untied it, and ſaw that it was a letter directed to him; he preſently went to finde <hi>Feniſe</hi> to let him read the ſame with him, not being willing to have a ſecret which he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54530:93"/>ſhould not have full knowledg of. They opened it, and ſaw that it was the Caſtalian tongue, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this diſcourſe.</p>

I cannot comprehend how he ſhould be come into this barbarous Country with the habits he weareth, and be in liberty, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Chriſtianity, which I cannot believe he hath done; for being iſſued from your bloud, he could not have committed ſo cowardly a perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ſo infamous an impiety; and although my juſt curioſity might merit ſome ſatisfaction, yet I do not hope that you can content it: I am now held ſo ſhort, that it is ſcarcely permitted me to leave the preſence of <hi>Selin,</hi> his paſſion and jealouſie is ſo violent, that he yet doubteth if I be where he findeth me; this is it that hath hindred me ſo long time from ſeeing you, and will yet deprive me of that contentment.

                        <p>The King hath certain birds of the bigneſs of Black-birds, which ſleep all the day, I know not whether it be by cuſtome which is given them, or their proper nature; but it ſeems that Heaven hath ſo ordained it for our conſolation particular. In the night they fly, and feed by candle-light, whither hunger makes them go as they ſee it. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me one of them, which ſhall be our faithfull meſſenger, if you pleaſe, this is the induſtry we will uſe. The night being come, you ſhall be in your Gallery, with a candle in a cleare lanthorne, and when I ſhall ſee that light, I will put out mine in my chamber, and let go the bird; he ſhall have a letter delicately faſtned under one of his wings, he will fly ſtrait to you, and pearch near your candle; you will eaſily take him, for he is very tame; then you may untie his letter, and having ſeen it, if you pleaſe, anſwer it; you may faſten it in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you ſhall ſee, then take away your candle, and I will light mine, and come to the window, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the bird will return to me. To proceed therein more ſecurely, and avoid danger, which may incurre, if our art ſhould be diſcovered; let us make proof therof with a little piece of white paper, in ſtead of a letter. Make your ſelf ready the night after this, and be in the Gallery about twelve a clock. God proſper happily the invention to his honour and glory.</p>

                     <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> embraced one another, ſeeing ſo cleare an appearance of a power to communicate and reſolve together some great enterpriſe for their common liberty, <hi>Magdelene</hi> being couragious, and <hi>Erimene</hi> very ingenious. It was ſhe that had writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54530:94"/>this Letter; for although the other knew the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalian language, having learned it of <hi>Erimene,</hi> ſhe was not ſo expert as to write in that ſtile; they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and admired this favourable invention, as in truth they had cauſe, it being extream rare, ſecret, and ſubtill; but there is nothing that a woman will not finde out to ſurmount the obſtacles vvhich op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her contentment: In vain doe fathers and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſhut their doors, and wall up their windows, and guard their walls, to avoid ſcandall, and to take from their Daughters and Wives the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they might have with their Lovers: the more they are ſhut up, the more leiſure is given them to exerciſe their wits, and to invent means to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come what hinders them; there is no Tower high enough, nor locks, nor doors, nor walls ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conſerve their honours, if they doe not guard them themſelves.</p>

This proximitie did not pleaſe her, for as much as it did not accord with the love that begun to take place in her heart. <hi>Erimene</hi> that penetrated into her moſt ſecret thoughts, perceived well that there was ſomething in the letter that pleaſed her not, and to be cleared of the ſuſpition which ſhe had conceived, ſhe prayed <hi>Magdelene</hi> to tell her what it was that troubled her, to the end ſhe might comfort her. Deere companion of my caprivitie ſaid <hi>Magdelene</hi> to her, you have juſt occaſion to complain of me, if I ſhould reſerve any ſecret from you, and to teſtifie that my heart is open to you, I will tell you truly, that ſince the houre that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made me to ſee the Cavalier, I have had extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary troubles. I know not whether it proceed from the influence of the ſtars, Blood, or the graces
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54530:95"/>of that gentleman, but I have ſuffered ſince that moment, unquietneſſes which I have hitherto beene ignorant of, and alſo I have a certaine ſorrow that he is ſo neere unto me, I have ſaid enough I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that I have ſo freely confeſſed my fragilitie unto you.</p>
                  <p>The ingenious <hi>Erimene</hi> having heard theſe words, which confirmed what ſhe had before imagined, thought that this was a proper occaſion to declare reciprocally to <hi>Magdelene,</hi> the ſecret which ſhe had hidden from her, to incourage her love which ought to ſerve as a foundation to the edifice of their liberty. Since that you have ſpoken to me with ſo much freedome, ſaid <hi>Erimene,</hi> J am obliged to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate you, leſt J give you occaſion to accuſe me of ingratitud, and this ſhal be now to acquit me of that which J owe to the affection which you have ſo particularly teſtifyed unto me. Vntill this preſent J have concealed from you, my true name, birth and country; not to follow the ordinary cuſtome of thoſe, who ſeeing themſelves in a miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vaunt to be of a greater extraction then they are, to the end to move compaſſion or courteſie in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. J told you at our firſt meeting that J was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Erimene,</hi> that J was of the kingdome of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and of meane condition, at this preſent J will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the truth to you. J am called <hi>Leonor Velazquez;</hi> J am of <hi>Toledo</hi> and of noble birth. Then ſhe made him an ample narration of all the hiſtory which we have already recited, of the death of <hi>Felix</hi> and her ſervant, and the cruelty of <hi>Don Jouan</hi> her brother; as it hath beene ſaid in the firſt booke, then ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſaying. Having then conſidered by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54530:96"/>end of this unhappy lover (which dyed for being diſguiſed in my perſon) by the cruelty of <hi>Don Jouan</hi> my brother, and ſeeing alſo that he had ſlaine her in thinking to have killed me, J conceived ſo great a hatred againſt him, and his preſence was ſo odious to me, that ſince that time it was impoſſible for me to ſtay in his company. For to ſeparate my ſelfe entirely from him, J leſt <hi>Toledo,</hi> and went with one of my coſens to the towne of <hi>Leride</hi> ſcituate in the province of <hi>Catalogna.</hi> Amongſt the pleaſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of this towne, J ſaw a Cavalier whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and good offices which he rendered mee, obliged me to give him my heart and ſoule, that J might not be reputed ſcornfull nor ingratefull. But with your permiſſion J will attend a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time to recount unto you how J came to ſee him, what ingaged me to love him, what adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brought me into this region, and what ſubject hath raviſhed from me this object of my affection. J will not for the preſent entertaine you with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things but what may be proper to comfort you in the paine you are in, and moderate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe of your ſpirit. For this cauſe J tell you that this Cavalier, which they diſguiſe with the name of <hi>Don Louis,</hi> is called <hi>Feniſe.</hi> J have divers times ſpoken and diſcourſed with him, as being the intimate friend of my brother <hi>Don Jouan.</hi> J knew then all his kindred, and as ſoone as your father let us ſee him with him, in Spaniſh habits, J knew him to be the ſame J have now told you. But having rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned upon the diſguiſement under the which your father preſented him to us, J doe imagine that he did it for feare his preſence which was unknowne to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54530:96"/>you ſhould give you ſome apprehenſion. To tell you by what meanes he is come hither, how he hath made friendſhip with your father, nor by what title he poſſeſſeth the houſe where he dwelleth, I cannot, for they are things I have no knowledge of, but of his valour, generoſitie, diſcretion and wit I can much commend; although not ſo much as his merits deſerve, ſo that if your ſorrow proceede from the feare you have he is too neere you, you may baniſh it at this inſtant, and place inſtead or it, a hope to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive one day at a glorious ſucceſſe, provided that we can but recover our deere libertie. I this day ſee, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Magdalene,</hi> that heaven is intereſſed in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance of our amitie, I receive ſo much conſolation from you, that I do no longer fear what troubles can befall me, the knowledge which you have given me of this Cavalier, diſperſeth all the confuſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with my ſpirit was troubled. In the paine which I had to believe what my father would make me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, I was a little moved to wiſh him well, but for the preſent, I muſt confeſſe to you that he poſſeſſeth my heart, and that I take an extreame pleaſure hi the increaſe of my affection. I perceive now nothing that can trouble me upon this ſubject but feare that he ſhould want inclination to eſteeme my amitie. No, No, anſwered <hi>Leonor,</hi> you muſt not trouble your ſelfe a new, I have experience enough, to judg of him the juſt contrary to that thought: I can aſſure you that he loveth you: And that it muſt be ſo, I will give you a teſtimony cleare enough, let us looke againe upon the letter, looke you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde this example which he giveth you, to uſe the Cypher: it is not without myſtery that he uſeth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54530:97"/>theſe words, I adore you: ading afterwards yet if you finde this not convenient, you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, the will ought to be free: but for my part I ſhall alwaies much eſteeme theſe Cyphers as moſt neceſſary to my good fortune; All theſe words are equivocall, and written by him with deſigne to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate unto you his feelings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magdelene</hi> eaſily believed what <hi>Leonor</hi> perſwaded her, becauſe her diſcourſe ſympathized with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſhe prayed her to make an anſwer for her to <hi>Feniſe,</hi> and to uſe the propounded cypher, as well to diſguiſe her thoughts to her father, as to let her lover ſee the eſteeme ſhe made of his counſell. <hi>Leonor</hi> was not much prayed to render her this ſervice, die was intereſſed therein by the deſire ſhe had to leave her captivitie; for ſhe knew <hi>Feniſe</hi> to be ſo hardy and able a man, that he would not ſpare his life to attempt their deliverance. She writ to him diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thoughts of her friend, leting him underſtand that ſhe was the ſecretary; that ſhe would ſerve him in all honeſt things he could deſire; and in the end conjured him, that in caſe there was any hopes of liberty, to remember her in the quality of the ſiſter of <hi>Don Jouan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This letter was ſent him hy the ayre as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Feniſe</hi> received it with joy, and read it with raviſhment, his love and courage augmented to the double:love is the ſonne of <hi>Mars</hi> as well as of <hi>Venus.</hi> What gladneſſe felt he when he knew that <hi>Leonor</hi> was companion to his miſtreſſe, he promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe better ſucceſſe in all his deſignes, as well for that which regarded his paſſion, as for the project he had to raviſh <hi>Magdelene</hi> from the poſſeſſion of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54530:97"/>king of <hi>Algier.</hi> He knew <hi>Leonor</hi> to have an excellent wit, and to be very capable to helpe in a great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: adding alſo, that in procuring her liberty he ſhould deſerve pardon for the death of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The next day after the receipt of this letter, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe</hi> went to viſit the <hi>Bacha Mahomet,</hi> to entertaine his amitie, and not to be unthankfull for the favours which he continually received from him: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> loved much his converſation he kept him to ſup with him, ſo that he was long before he returned to his owne houſe. In the interim, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> ſtayed there to watch if there was any newes from <hi>Magdelene</hi> &amp; as he walked in the Gallery, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from to time this amiable window, about a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the clock at night he there perceived a light, this made him thinke that the meſſenger, might well have ſome diſpatch, to bring to him, and thereupon he went to fetch a light, placed it in the gallery as a counterſigne, it was ſcarcely ſeene when that of the window appeared no more, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the faithfull bird arrived with this writing which was directed to <hi>Feniſe,</hi> yet <hi>Frederick,</hi> opened it, for they were in ſo good intelligence that there was no ſecret betwixt them.</p>

                        <p>I Doe not know whether or no my father hath told you, that for a long time the King of <hi>Algier,</hi> hath proſecuted and ſolicited me to conſent to the

At the preſent his paſſion preſſeth him ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that ſince yeſterday he hath threatened me to convert his love into anger, and inſtead of reſpects and favours, which I may hope from him, I ſhall receive cruell rigours, if I doe not reſolve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him within a moneth.

                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> being returned to his houſe, <hi>Frederick</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54530:98"/>him the letter he had received, the which cauſed great diſquietneſſe in them both the reſt of the night. They laboured with their ſpirits to invent ſome ſtratagem to deliver this beauty from the pain wherein ſhe was, but as many deſignes as they plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many difficulties they found in the execution thereof. In the end after divers propoſitions, they could not foreſee any good ſucceſſe, by reaſon of the recluſe life which <hi>Selin</hi> made them lead; yet they were reſolved to undermine the tower where <hi>Magdelene</hi> lodged, and ſteale her away with <hi>Leonor,</hi> when there ſhould any veſſell arrive, wherein they might carry them into <hi>Spaine.</hi> The houſe of <hi>Feniſe</hi> was in a ſcituation very favourable to their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, near to the Palace, and without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle betwixt them, the ſpace was nothing but a garden, which appertained to <hi>Feniſe;</hi> beſides, the earth was ſandy and eaſie to digge. All the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie was to finde an invention to ſuſtain the earth; for being ſandy, it was ſubject to fall in, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overthrow them and choak them in their work. But <hi>Frederick</hi> was of opinion to break up a boarded floor in <hi>Feniſe</hi> his houſe, to take the boards and joiſts to ſerve for that buſineſſe. Having ripely conſulted the execution of this project, and ſeeing that this was the onely meanes for their ſafety, they reſolved to try their fortune; they gave advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the priſoners, counſelling <hi>Magdelene</hi> to change her lodging, and to pray the King to give her the loweſt room of the tower where ſhe was, and alſo to take the extent of her lodging with a thread, and to ſend it by their ordinary poſt, to the end they might not open the mouth of the mine in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54530:99"/>place but her chamber. All this was executed as it was deviſed, the King agreed with a good heart, that <hi>Magdelene</hi> ſhould lodge where ſhee thought good, ſo that ſhe and <hi>Leonor</hi> tooke juſtly the meaſure, and ſent it to them. In the meane time <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> were provided of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper for their deſigne, they ſet their levell to the which the knowledge of the Mathematiques ſerves perfectly which comprehends Geometry, which <hi>Feniſe</hi> underſtood excellently, and during the ſilence of the night, whilſt men ſlept they wrought with an incomparable courage underpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the earth as they hollowed it. Heaven which had inſpired them with this invention, conducted their hands ſo happily, that within a little diſtance from the place where they begun their work, and the firſt night they found a ſtraight cave, which extended it ſelf in length directly towards the end of their deſign. Raviſhed with joy they fell incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently upon their knees, and gave thanks to God being perſwaded that this could not have happened but by miracle. They entred boldly therein, and law that it was the work of man, and ended at the foundation of the wall of the Palace; this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was ſo large and ſtrong, that other coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages leſſe conſtant then theirs, would have given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the enterpriſe, there were ſuch terrible ſtones, that for to demoliſh and diſplace onely one, they muſt conſume all their force, tooles and time; they gave not over, for all that, they viſited, ſearched, and groped all over with their irons, in the end they knocked in a place which founded not like ſtone, they regarded more carefully, and knew that it
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54530:99"/>was a little door covered with bars of iron, ſo ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty that it was not to be diſtinguiſhed from the ſtone, but onely with the touch of a hammer. They contented themſelves with their labour for this time, and went to repoſe the reſt of the night, with reſolution to continue the next day, and labour to break this door with croes of Iron, and force the bolts wherewith it was ſhut. The beginning of the night following, as <hi>Frederick</hi> walked in the Gallery, expecting the houre to goe to work, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter, wherein was incloſed the thrid which contained the neceſſary meaſure, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conducting of the opening of the mine, by which letter they learned, that it was be done under the chamber of <hi>Leonor,</hi> becauſe that of <hi>Magdelene</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced more into the Palace by two fathoms. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with an extraordinary courage, they went into their mine, furniſhed with files, croes, pincers, and other irons proper to break and beat in pieces all obſtacles that they ſhould meet with. They had not ſo much trouble as they apprehended, time and moiſture had wrought for them, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more than the half of their pains, the bolts and locks were ſo old, ruſty, and conſumed, that they ſcarcely preſented their irons to them, but they yeelded to them, and opened upon them, they found the entry ſtopped with plankes, and a certain kinde of matter like plaiſter, which did not much reſiſt them, paſſing further they ſaw a greater concavitie, which extended it ſelf two wayes, they took that they judged moſt fit for their project; after they viſited the other in every corner, but amongſt all theſe turnings under ground, they could not finde
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54530:100"/>any iſſue nor entrance, but that which they had made, they were both raviſhed with aſtoniſhment, and yet very glad, thinking they might now work ſecurely, without being ſurpriſed or diſcovered, as they apprehended before they had broken the door, not knowing what they ſhould find on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. They begun to conſider for what uſe theſe caverns were, and in the end imagined, that ſome Tyrant of <hi>Algier,</hi> fearing he ſhould loſe his Kingdom, and have his perſon ſeiſed upon, had cauſed them to be made to ſave himſelfe, if there ſhould be occaſion, and that time had taken away the memory thereof, and filled up the entry. Then they tooke the meaſure which was ſent them, and multiplying it as often as the Letter ſpoke of, found that one of the armes of theſe Caves reached juſt under the Lodging of <hi>Leonor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twelve Foote diſtant from that of <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They gave over work and retired, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof to thoſe for whom they did it; they ſent them word that it ſeemed that God wrought for them, and conducted their enterpriſe, having found all their work almoſt done, by the means of caves which they found, telling them alſo, that they believed they were come under the lodging of <hi>Leonor:</hi> Theſe two friends, raviſhed with joy of this comfortable newes, anſwered them, that the night following <hi>Leonor</hi> would knock with a piece of wood upon the floor of her chamber, to give them a certaine ſigne of the place where ſhe was.</p>
                  <p>With this intelligence <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54530:100"/>their exerciſe of labouring pioners, and when thoſe planks and boards they were provided of, were uſefull unto them, they underpropped the vault for fear of being overthrown, and at the end of their work to end their lives. This work was extream painfull for theſe men which were not accuſtomed to it, beſides, being but two, they could have done no great matter: In effect, without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theſe hollow places which they found, they had died in the enterpriſe. All they did, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſix nights, was only to underprop as well as they could that compaſſe of the vault where they pretended to make the hole; and yet they were carefull to advertiſe <hi>Magdelene</hi> and <hi>Leonor</hi> thereof, to the end they ſhould not loſe the hope they had given them; having underpropped it, they yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed three nights to break the vault, ever and anon liſtning to judge of the thickneſs by the blows which they expected muſt be given by <hi>Leonor</hi> or <hi>Magdelene.</hi> In the end they heard them, which made a harmony which charmed their ſences; this animated their courages, but their forces failed them, ſo that for to take new vigour they remitted the reſt of their travail untill another night; it was impatiently expected, but it came according to its order, they began again to break, but they had ſcarcely imployed a quarter of an hour, when they ſaw they had no more need of croes and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and that the earth fell down of it ſelf. Then <hi>Leonor,</hi> who had heard the noiſe of their hammers, knocked upon the floor of her lodging, and made her ſelf to be heard ſo clearly to our workmen, that they judged than they had not above two foot
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54530:101"/>of thickneſſe left; they continued vigorouſly, and the ſtones and earth came ſo faſt towards their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that in a little time they pierced and entred into the chamber of <hi>Leonor,</hi> whom they found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and who received them with amorous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements. Having thanked God for this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py event, they went to repoſe, deferring untill the next day the ſeeing of <hi>Magdelene,</hi> who was retired, not believing that they could this night fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their enterpriſe, and becauſe It was three a clock, <hi>Leonor</hi> judged they ought not to waken her, for fear that ſome unexpected misfortune might diſcover their ſecret. This judicious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obliged the two friends to moderate the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of their deſires, not for to hazard that in a moment, which they hoped to poſſeſſe many years; when they were departed, <hi>Leonor</hi> ſet a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over the mouth of the Myne, and put a great Turky Carpet upon it, and as ſoon as it was day ſhe went into the chamber of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with this pleaſant and miraculous newes; <hi>Magdelene</hi> would ſcarcely take time to dreſſe her ſelf, ſhe was ſo impatient to ſee this happy hole. She conſidered with joy and admiration, figuring to her ſelf, that although it tended towards the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth, yet it was the way to Paradiſe, and a favourable iſſue to eſcape out of the hands of theſe Infidels, and come again into the exerciſe of the ſoveraign and only Religion. She was a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that <hi>Leonor</hi> had enjoyed alone the preſence of her Father and Lover, reproaching her for not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her; but <hi>Leonor</hi> ſatisfied her, letting her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, as it was true, that they did but only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54530:101"/>into the chamber, and vvent out again, for the day approached, vvhich vvould not ſuffer them to ſtay longer there, and that ſhe ſhould ſee them vvith more conveniency the night follovving: This hope contented and diſquieted her at the ſame time, for vvhen one approacheth the poſſeſſion of a benefit, they deſire it vvith more violence, foraſmuch as they better knovv the value thereof, and alſo preſume that there is no more trouble to attain it. This night ſo impatiently expected being come, in the greateſt ſilence therof, <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Cave, with a ſtaff they knocked ſoftly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the table that covered the mouth of the Mine, to let them know that they were there, and to know if they might enter, at the ſame inſtant they ſaw ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>Magdelene</hi> and <hi>Leonor</hi> with a light, who ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out their arms to them, crying for joy, and pittying the pains that this Father and Lover had taken for their ſakes; neceſſity, which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of invention, taught <hi>Femoſe</hi> to knock nails into the planks they had brought to ſerve for a ladder, to mount to the center of his affections, he made <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drick</hi> paſſe the firſt, he climbing to aſſiſt him, becauſe his age took away his agility. It is impoſſible to expreſſe here the joy of theſe four perſons, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Magdelene</hi> and <hi>Feniſe;</hi> ſhe did not know whom ſhe ſhould imbrace firſt, her Father, or her over; bloud counſelled her to go to the one, and love to the other; but after having ſuffered this little combate in ſpirit, as moſt wife and diſcreet, ſhe caſt her ſelf upon her knees before her Father, and held his knees imbraced long time, and in the interim courteouſly caſt her eyes upon glorious
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54530:102"/>
                     <hi>Feniſe</hi> who commended the action of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, as teſtifying an acknowledgment of the obligations ſhe had to this venerable old man who had ſuffered himſelfe to be a ſlave ſo many yeares for the love of her. <hi>Frederick</hi> had enjoyed longer time, the raviſhing imbracements of his daughter, if <hi>Feniſe</hi> had not beene preſent, but deſiring he ſhould partake of his contentment, he made <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> riſe and preſented her to our Cavalier. He wanted not much at that time of proſtrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, upon the earth to adore her, for ſhe was ſo ſhining with attractions of beauty and joy, which is the moſt excellent paint, and which had given her complexion ſo lively a luſter, that he believed he ſaw a goddeſſe before him. She came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him with a grave modeſtie, and <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſaluted her withal the reſpect &amp; reverence ſhe merited; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rendered her this homage, he ran to imbrace <hi>Leonor,</hi> to whom <hi>Frederick</hi> had made his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they held no ſuperfluous diſcourſe for feare of loſing time which was ſo deere to them. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi> would willingly have exaggerated his paſſion, and teſtified his Eloquence in this action, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to leave amorous deviſes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the meanes to finiſh that which they had ſo happily begun; their reſolution was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their flight for the third night after, and that <hi>Magdelene</hi> and <hi>Leonor</hi> ſhould diſguiſe themſelves in Turkiſh habits which <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſhould bring them, who charged himſelfe with that diligence, and all others that ſhould be neceſſary for the ſtealing of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Vpon this determination, they begun their embracements and teares, and tooke leave one of another to diſpoſe of themſelves to finiſh the work
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54530:102"/>they had ſo well begun; whoſoever had diligently held the countenances of <hi>Magdelene</hi> &amp; <hi>Leonor</hi> might well have obſerved the ſecret joy of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>The King ſeeing the time approach that he had given <hi>Magdelene</hi> to reſolve to conſent to his will, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited her more often then ordinary, thinking to learne by her carriage her determination. He came the next day after this deere meeting into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to ſee her new lodging, and ſeeing him arrive, ſhe met him with ſuch cherefullneſſe, that the King was aſtoniſhed at this pleaſant change, for he never ſaw her before but with teares in her eyes, and ſighes in her mouth. He knew not to what to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute theſe gracious actions, whether to the feare ſhe had to ſee her father ſuffer as he had threatened, or her ſenſibleneſſe of the honour he intended to doe her in taking her for his wife. But without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining more curiouſly the originall of this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he was infinitly ſatisfied, as well with her good reception as charming entertainement: for there is no creature in the world ſo proper to make a deception as a woman.</p>
                  <p>The King being retired, believing that he had won her heart and affections, and that ſhe was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to accompliſh his deſires, would teſtifie unto her the good and profit ſhe ſhould in time receive from his liberalitie. He ſent her a box of gold inam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled, wherein there was two bracelets and a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>and of Diamonds of very great value. She received them with all her heart in making a thouſand hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble complements; ſaying this magnificence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, ſeeing that a Lord and maſter made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to his ſlave. <hi>Leonor</hi> felt alſo the good humour of the King, ſhe had for her part a chaine of pearle
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54530:103"/>which was not of much leſſe value then the gift he had made to <hi>Magdelene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All things hapened as happily as they could wiſh for Fortune who had bin ſo contrary to them, and who had proved their courages upon a thouſand occaſions, then treated them moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and ſhewed her ſelfe favourable upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. At that time ſhe conducted to the port of <hi>Algier</hi> two veſſells of Pirats, who uſed no other exerciſe, but rob upon the ſea all the veſſells they could render themſelves maſters of, ſharing their booty with the King <hi>Selin.</hi> The one of theſe pirats was called <hi>Rouſtan</hi> and the other <hi>Nazouf. Feniſe</hi> being informed of their arrivall, made a deſigne to ſerve himſelfe of the ſhip of <hi>Nazouf</hi> to ſteale away the captives; for this purpoſe he ſuborned with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver two Moores which came with this Pirate, and made them declare upon oath, that <hi>Nazouf</hi> defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded daily the King of the tribute which was due to him, concealing and hiding the better halfe of the booty which he made at ſea, without giving him partas he was bound. Upon this depoſition they ſeized upon the Pirate, and made him priſoner, and thereby his voyage was ſtayed. <hi>Rouſtan</hi> which was the head of the other ſhip departed immediately to exerciſe his ordinary trade. <hi>Feniſe</hi> viſited the ſhip of <hi>Nazouf,</hi> informed himſelfe what armes was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, of the men that kept it, and of all other things that he judged neceſſary to his intention.</p>
                  <p>The terme being come ſo impatiently deſired by our four chriſtians, the night rendered her ſelfe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their deſigne, ſhe aſſembled all her darkneſſes to warrant them from the danger they might run. <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> went by the ſame way they had
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54530:103"/>traced with ſo much paine into the chamber of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> carrying with them the two turkiſh habits, wherein it was determined that <hi>Magdelene</hi> and ſhe ſhould cloath themſelves as they did. Having hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in many places of their habits thoſe precious jewells which the King had given them, in the hope he had that <hi>Magdelene</hi> ſhould be his wife; they found themſelves ready to leave the the palace, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves to the diſcretion of Fortune. Then without loſing time, <hi>Feniſe</hi> made but one leape into the floore of the mine, being ſtrong and diſpoſed, to the end he might helpe this feareful troope to deſcend, who marched under his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. <hi>Frederick</hi> deſcended after him, to whom <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi> gave his hand, and a dark lanterne which he held, then he mounted again for fear his miſtreſſe or <hi>Leonor</hi> ſhould hurt themſelves; having ſafely let them downe, he lightly threw himſelfe after them and carefully guiding them, they begun their way by theſe horrible places under ground. They had ſcarcely paſſed ſix or eight paces, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the earth to fall upon them, as if they ſhould be overthrowne and buried quick, which terrified them very much, not knowing whether they ſhould advance or recule, but they were delivered from this terrible apprehenſion, by another allarme which was not leſſe fearefull. As they begun againe their way, animated by the courage of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> which had taken the candle out of the lanterne to ſee more clearely, the earth fell downe a ſecond time upon their heads, and a man fell before them at their feet crying <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the aire he moved in falling put out the candle which <hi>Feniſe</hi> carryed. Oh heaven,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54530:104"/>what feare! yet this generous Cavalier was not aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; it is a dead man ſaid he, let us goe on, and going the firſt held his miſtreſſe by the hand, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers followed. He would have continued his way, and advanced towards the vaulted caves; but <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> made him ſtay; ſaying they ſhould aſſiſt him that was falne, and that it was ſome chriſtian ſlave; ſince that at the very inſtant of his fall he had called upon the holy name of God: that (that being ſo as it was very probable) he would helpe them the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to their ſhip, her advice was approved; they helped him to riſe, and went on leading him with them, without troubling themſelves to interrogate him, contenting themſelves to believe he was a chriſtian. They had much incommodity to get out of theſe caves for want of light not knowing which way to take; at every ſtep they ſtumbled, and fell one upon the other by reaſon of the ſtones and clods of the earth that were under their feet. In the end they got to the houſe of <hi>Feniſe</hi> where <hi>Magdelene</hi> and <hi>Leonor</hi> tooke breath which they had loſt by weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and feare in this terrible paſſage. <hi>Feniſe</hi> begun to approach this ſlave with a candle in his hand to ſee who it was they had received unto their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when he heard a violent knocking at the doore of this houſe. Feare begun then to ſeiſe upon the hearts of the moſt determined of the company, they looke one upon another without ſpeaking word, or knowing what to reſolve. And <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſeeing that the blowes doubled, animated his reſolution, and went to ſee who knocked ſo impatiently at his doore: he knew that it was the ſlave ſavourite to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who prayed him from his maſter to come
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54530:104"/>preſently to him, for an affaire wherein diligence was ſo neceſſary, that it would ſave him his life. <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſent away the ſlave aſſuring him that he would preſently follow him.</p>
                  <p>This newes troubled our Cavalier more then all the paſſed alarmes had done, on one ſide, he was called to the ſuccour of his friend and benefactor, and on the other ſide he was retained by his paſſion and honour not to abandon the troope that had no hope but in his aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Then he feared that as ſoon as day ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>Magdelenes</hi> flight would be perceived in the Kings lodging. In fine, he found means to perform the one and the other obligation, hee armed the two women, as <hi>Frederick</hi> already was, with Carabines and Cymitars, and left his lodging, taking what hee had the moſt precious, of ſilver and jewels and the moſt eaſie to carry, and carryed them to the veſſell of <hi>Nazouf,</hi> as faigning to give them in guard, by the Kings commandement, untill that <hi>Nazouf</hi> who was priſoner, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced or juſtified of the accuſation he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with, advertiſing them that as ſoon as hee had ſeen <hi>Mahomet</hi> he would returne to them, and put them to ſea, as they went to execute this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they ſaw the ſame ſlave come running to them, conjuring <hi>Feniſe</hi> to make haſt, otherwiſe his Maiſter was loſt. So that ſeeing himſelf thus preſſed, he broke the determination which he had taken, and went to the lodging of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> taking with him theſe four perſons, letting the ſlave know that they were men of confidence and valour wherewith he was accompanyed to ſerve <hi>Mahomet</hi> in caſe of need;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54530:105"/>being arrived at the door, <hi>Feniſe</hi> made his company attend at a mean diſtance, whilſt he went to ſpeak to the <hi>Bacha:</hi> Hee found him at the entry of his houſe, and by a very ſhort diſcourſe, let <hi>Feniſe</hi> know the pain he was in; Deare friend, ſayd he, I am falne into a misfortune, wherein I have need of the aſſiſtance of a man of valour and loyalty as you are, to helpe mee to ſave my life. It is the merit of this faire Chriſtian here (ſhewing him <hi>Eufemie</hi> which accompanied him) which hath obliged me to an action wherewith the King will be offended: She hath been a long time perſecuted by the paſſion of a Moore coſen to the King, to adhere to his ſenſualities, and although ſhee hath often prayed him to deſiſt from theſe importunities, and impertinent purſuites, he forbore not to goe on. This inſolent would try his good fortune, and to the contempt of my reſpect, is entered into my houſe by the means of a ſervant which he had gained, to the end to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he deſired of <hi>Eufemie,</hi> or elſe to render her ſome notorious diſpleaſure. And I knowing her innocence, and the raſhneſſe of this Moore, I ſurpriſed him as he put the firſt foot into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her of this fair one, and have made him finde in the ſame place the laſt ſtep of his life, his body is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but this Homicide will be diſcovered, as ſoon as it ſhall be day. The King will not pardon me, ſince that I have violated the reſpect due to his blood, whereof he is proudly jealous. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations hinder mee now from reaſoning, and looking after means to warrant me from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54530:105"/>wherein I am; therefore I have recourſe to your good wit, and caſt my ſelfe into your armes with this Chriſtian Lady to aſſiſt me with your counſell, and generous effects. <hi>Feniſe</hi> having heard this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, ſetting aſide complements, told him, that he muſt put <hi>Eufemie</hi> into mans apparell; <hi>Mahomet</hi> did it incontinently; then ſeiſing upon many ſtones, and a good quantity of ſequines, with the aide and aſſiſtance of his faithfull ſlave which he tooke with them, he abandoned himſelf to the faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Feniſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They went together to get the gate open, where they ſtood in need of no ſmall credit; for there is a marvellous care obſerved in keeping the gates of this Town, but the Officers and Porters knowing the <hi>Bacha</hi> and <hi>Subbacha,</hi> believed that they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to execute ſome command of the Kings, as they told them, they were going to ſeiſe upon a great booty, which <hi>Nazouf</hi> had concealed, with deſign to fruſtrate the King of his right, and for this cauſe they took with them theſe men which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, and particularly this ſlave, which knew where the riches were hidden; in ſaying ſo, they ſhewed him that fell into the Mine. This diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation agreed very well with the impriſonment of <hi>Nazouf,</hi> which every one already knew, ſo that the gate was freely opened unto them, beſides <hi>Mahomet</hi> being the Kings favourite, they durſt not doubt of what he ſaid. The <hi>Bacba</hi> being out of the Town (whereof the gate was incontinently ſhut after them) took notice of the company which were with <hi>Feniſe,</hi> fearing that ſo great a number might cauſe ſome confuſion in their enterpriſe; he prayed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54530:106"/>our Cavalier to rid himſelf of theſe people, and ſend them back againe; but <hi>Feniſe</hi> aſsured him of them, and prayed him to take care for nothing, but to follow him and confide in him, and in thoſe that accompanyed him. Thereupon they came near the veſſell, <hi>Feniſe</hi> called to thoſe that guarded it; for he had informed himſelf of their names when he viſited it; preſently <hi>Feniſe</hi> and his unknown troope entered, which were courteouſly received by the Mariners, if there can be any courteſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe people. They were ſcarcely entred, when by the ayd and intelligence of ſome of thoſe of the ſhip, which <hi>Feniſe</hi> had gained, or rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned with money and fair promiſes, they ſeiſed upon all the Moores which were in the ſhip, and diſarmed them, they looſed the captives which were at the oares, and put the Moores in their places, making them alſo to prove the ſtrange changes of fortune. This being done, without proviſion of victuals or arms, but what they found in the ſhip; <hi>Feniſe</hi> cut the cord that held the veſſell to the port, and by force of arms they got out of the ſhallow roade into the main ſea. The women were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beſt room of the veſſell, where they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained themſelves with their prodigious adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, their long captivity, and the hopes they had ſhortly to ſee again their dear country <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there to enjoy the ſweet repoſe of life. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim <hi>Feniſe, Frederick,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> with the two ſlaves, that is to ſay, he they found in the Mine, &amp; he belonging to <hi>Mahomet</hi> which he had brought with him, being guilty of the death of the King of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> coſen, were all upon the watch, as well to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54530:106"/>ſee if they were followed, as to make the Moores, whom they had chained, to row with all their force, that they might get away the ſooner. The day being come, <hi>Feniſe</hi> regarding all thoſe in the veſſell, conſidered the faſhion and carriage of the ſlave of the Mine, admiring that his fortune had ſerved her ſelf of ſo ſtrange a means to give him his liberty; by conſidering of him, he judged him to be of ſome noble birth, and in this imagination, he came to him, praying him to content his curioſity, and let him know how he had been taken by theſe Barbarians, and made ſlave, and by what happy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident he was falne into the mine there to finde his liberty. Then this unknown, with a modeſt ſmile, teſtifying his willingneſſe to ſatisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> begunne his hiſtory with this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Complement, ſpeaking in the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> tongue.</p>
                  <p>Generous Cavalier, I would willingly beſeech you to diſpence with me for this obedience, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall you command me to make, requireth ſo much patience and time to hear it, and there are ſo many ſad and tragique accidents therein, that I am affraid you will be much troubled before I ſhall be at the middle thereof, or that the end will make you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely melancholique. Yet ſince it is your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I will begin this ſad diſcourſe, to finiſh it when you command me ſilence.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORIE OF <hi>DON JAME</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere is a famous and rich Town in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Catalogne,</hi> called <hi>Leride.</hi> It pleaſed Heaven about twenty four years agone to let me be born there, of a noble Family, and of good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; the greateſt part of thoſe who are far from their Country ſpeak in this manner of their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, although very often one may know their lying; but whoſoever will inform himſelf of my Line, when we ſhall arrive at the Port, if God conduct us thither, ſhall finde my words true. The exceſſes of youth, which very few men eſcape, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away my Father to laſcivious affections, from whence I had a baſtard Brother; he was of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance good enough, but of ill effects. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſed him to be brought very young into the arms of my Mother, to bring him up, which was an action more raſh then civill. She was more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable then ſhe ought to have been, for Wives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are guilty of the faults of their Husbands, not that they love them , but becauſe in ſupporting their firſt debauches, they give occaſion for ſeconds. She took as great care to bring him up as if he had been her proper child; nevertheleſſe ſhe loved him but as a ſtranger. I had, ſome few years more then he, but although I was in an age of innocence, I was as indifferent to my Father as if I had not been his child, or to ſay better, as odious to ſee as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: There are Fathers that have leſſe humanity
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54530:107"/>then ſavage beaſts; he loved <hi>Lucian</hi> as much as he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, this was the name of this baſtard brother; I cannot better exaggerate the affection which he bore him, then in ſaying ſo. We had a Siſter which was a little younger then we, but advantagiouſly fair, and we were all three brought up at the ſame place, our Fathers houſe. During our infancy, <hi>Lucian</hi> and I were almoſt alwayes in debate, but being but for ſlight things, our diſſentions were incontinently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, ſometimes for fear of our Father, and ſometimes for fear of being puniſhed by thoſe who had care of our educations. But when we had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the age of twenty yeares, he became more audacious, and I more cholerick; he envied the demonſtrations of amity which my mother uſed towards me, and I was as envious of the affection my Father bore him; theſe favours gave him a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious liberty, liberty boldneſſe, and boldneſſe inſolence to doe ſo many evill actions, that he got the reputation of a moſt perfidious and infamous perſon; he had no other exerciſe then to ruin the honours of thoſe he could meet with, for whether their ſimplicities ſuffered him to ſurprize them, or that they reſiſted his diſhoneſt deſires, he did not forbear to ſlander them; his tongue was ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that he ſpake ill indifferently of all women, publiſhing as ſoon lies as truths, and vaunting of that which he did not, as well as of that which he did. The diſorders of his life mounted to ſuch an exceſſe, that he had a deſign to enterpriſe upon the honour of his owne Siſter, the ſacred limits of bloud, her proper vertue, nor my vigilant care, could not retain him; I was advertiſed of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54530:108"/>project by a ſervant whom he thought to have rendred adherent to his abominable intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe ſhe had ſuffered him to communicate them unto her; but this was a diſcreet Maid, who had given him this audience, but only that he might confide in her, and hinder him from ſeeking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, who it might be would not have carried her ſelf ſo diſcreetly therein. She did but hear him to learn his reſolutions, and give me notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that I might prudently prevent them. When this Maid had told me what ſhe knew thereof, I could ſcarcely believe her, the thing was ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; but conſidering the manners of the perſon, and comparing them with the diſcourſe of this Maid, I found he was capable to commit actions yet more monſtrous. I would be wiſe in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and inform my ſelf of the truth, to the end that the vengeance I hoped to take, might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed juſt, and not raſh. From that hour mine eyes were Sentinels over the words and actions of <hi>Lucian;</hi> he made no ſtep, nor ever approached near the place where <hi>Olinde</hi> was, ſo mine innocent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was called, that I did not diſcreetly watch him, from whence I found more confirmation of the truth of the report which was made me then I would have done; yet I diſſembled the trouble of my mind, with intention to govern my ſelf with ſuch induſtry, that at the ſame time his deſignes ſhould be broken, my Siſter delivered from his perſecutions, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence chaſtiſed, my vengeance accompliſhed, and my ſelf without feare of being known for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his death. I diſguiſed my ſelf in the night, and followed him when he went about the <hi>ſtreets,</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:54530:108"/>to attrap him all alone, and let him feele the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my choler, in killing him. One time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, when I went to ſearch him with this deſigne, after having long time walked about the Town, and the places of debauches, where I knew he ordinarily frequented, without meeting with him, in entring into the ſtreet where the houſe of <hi>Don Ignigo Orozco</hi> is ſituate, one of the principall Cavaliers of the City, I heard a confuſed noyſe of voices; I went towards this houſe, and knew that it was there where the rumour was, but yet I knew not what was the cauſe thereof at the ſame time. I ſaw two men unknown, which approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as I did with like curioſity; I came to the doore, and perceived the houſe all within to be on fire, which did not only threaten to conſume the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but alſo the goods and perſons which were therein, and all this misfortune came by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a Lacquey, who had faſtned a candle againſt a woodden ſeeling.</p>
                  <p>From moment to moment the flames augmented with ſo much fury that ſome of the men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to leap out of the windowes, ſeeing the ſtairs on fire; the women being leſſe couragious, ſtayed beſieged in their chambers, crying for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and cauſing great pitty to thoſe who heard them. Amongſt the reſt which ſuffered theſe fears, I perceived through the flames and ſmoak, a Lady, whoſe beauty and cloaths teſtified her to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of eſteeme; and ſeeing the extreame neceſſity which preſſed them, I caſt my ſelf into the houſe, and taking a great hammer from a man that I met, which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54530:109"/>was come to give ſuccour, I broke a thin wall and entered into the chamber where the poore deſolates were, amongſt the which I ſaw ſaw the originall of my firſt admiration, which was in a ſwound, I tooke her in mine armes, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her cut of this fearefull danger which threatened her, making all the reſt which were priſoners with her to come out. As this accident hapned, during the firſt ſleepe of the whole family, this lady was wakened in a fright, and being preſently caſt into the floore, was not clothed but onely with a petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coate and waſt coate, the one of ſattin richly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered with flowers of gold and ſilver, and the other pinked, through the which appeared a breaſt of ſnow capable to inflame ice it ſelfe. Seeing her ſo little covered, I caſt my cloake over her body. I doe not know whether it was to keepe her warme; or for feare ſhe ſhould inflame the heart of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſhe had done mine, for what marble could have beene inſenſible of ſo many attractions? As I carried her away being yet in her ſwound, thoſe two men which I met in coming to the dore, came to me with their ſwords in their hands, and one of them who had his face covered with cipres, becauſe he would not be known, put himſelf in action to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh from me the conqueſt which I had made with ſo much courage, and to take from me the worthy object of my loue. In this violence ſeeing my ſelfe without my ſword; which I had quitted having no uſe thereof againſt the fire, I knew not what to doe, but to uſe words, and repreſent to them, that their enterpriſe was not onely incivill, but very coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infamous, to ſet upon a man without armes,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54530:109"/>and in ſaving a lady of her condition from the fire. The other woman which accompanied her, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed with this inſolence begun to cry for helpe, then the companion of him that had ſet upon me in the cypres maske gave me a great thruſt in the right ſide which paſſed quite through my body, then turning his face he fled with the other, I would have run after them, but the blood which iſſued in abundance out of the wound rendered me ſo feeble that I fell downe at the ſecond ſtep. In the interim this lady returned from her ſwound much more vigorous then before, having two ſoules for one, for I had given her mine. Yet ſhe was like to dye for feare, opening her eyes, and ſeeing a man at her feete all covered with blood, and whoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits teſtified that he was not of baſe condition. Whilſt ſhe was in this new aſtoniſhment, the maſter and ſervants of a neighbouring houſe came out, ſome to helpe this lady, and others to aſſiſt to quench the fire: which whilſt they did, the others carryed away this beauty to their houſe with one of her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens which accompanied her. At the ſame inſtant <hi>Don Jgnigo</hi> was told of the diſaſter which was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me in ſaving from the fire , the moſt preticus goods of his houſe; And without knowing who I was, he ran preſently to cauſe me to be ſuccoured, having knowne me, he had his heart ſeized with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſorrow, ſeeing that this misfortune came by raeſon of the good office I had rendred him. He made me incontinently be carried to my lodging, accompanying me, &amp; proteſting to revenge me rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly if he could diſcover the infamous culpable,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54530:110"/>finding himſelfe extreamely intereſſed in the offence. As ſoon as they begun to look to my wounds, <hi>Lucian</hi> arrived faining to be extreamely afflicted for my misfortune, he informed himſelfe of whom I had received this injury, promiſing to imploy his life to be revenged of them. There were ſo skilfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perators about this cure that in a few dayes I was perfectly healed, for the blow did not offend any inward part, nor entred much within the body; the ſervant which had given me the firſt notice of the pernitious projects of <hi>Lucian,</hi> ſeeing me ready to to go abroade, came to me into my chamber telling me that ſhe had a new ſecret to communicate to me: and after ſhe was aſſured that no body could heare her, ſhe held me this diſcourſe, ſpeaking ſoftly. Sir ſaid ſhe, I ſhould eſteeme my ſelfe confederate with with your enemies, if after having diſcovered a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration they have made againſt you, I ſhould not advertiſe you thereof; herein you ſhall know how much I eſteeme the conſervation of your perſon, as you have already made proofe of the reſpect I beare to your honour in what I have heretofore told you. You muſt know then, that the night after you were hurt, about twelve a clock, I heard a talking in in the chamber of <hi>Lucian</hi> by reaſon of ſome indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I had which would not ſuffer me to ſleeep, I aroſe and put my head to my window (which you know looketh into the court over againſt that of <hi>Lucian,</hi> which hath the ſame view but a little lower then mine) I could eaſily ſee thorough the glaſſe what they did there, becauſe there was a light. I ſaw there was aſhes upon the table, and that with the end of a flat ſtick he made cleane his ſword, full of

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and in doing thereof, I heard him hold this diſcourſe to <hi>Fabrice,</hi> the man that ſerveth him, and whom he truſteth with his inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſignes, ſince that which we did the laſt night, there are two things which trouble my ſpirit. The firſt, that mine arme had no more force nor addreſſe but to leave in doubt the life of <hi>Don Jame,</hi> that was the name I bore when I was happier then I now am.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely was this name ſpoken, when faire <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> which heard it, and who being at the dore of the chamber of the poope had alſo heard the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this recitall, came with her armes open &amp; caſt them about the neck of <hi>Don Jame,</hi> ah, my deere hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſaid ſhe, in crying out, it is poſſible that thou art this day ſo neere me? he knowing the voice and countenance of her that ſpoke; Ah God! is it you my deare <hi>Leonor?</hi> ſaying ſo he imbraced her recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and they remained faſtened together without being able to ſpeake any more. They were ſo raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy, that they wanted not much of giving up their ſoules in this tranſport. After a good ſpace of time, they opened their armes, and beheld one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with teares in their eyes, <hi>Don Jame</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his, indeavoured to reprove thoſe of <hi>Leonor,</hi> telling her that thoſe that weepe for joy, ought to have no teares for their troubles. All thoſe that ſaw theſe amorous actions, marvelled at this prodigious encounter, which gave <hi>Feniſe</hi> the more curioſitie to know the end of the hiſtory begun, the which <hi>Don Jame</hi> (having reunited his ſpirits moved with the ſuddain apparition of this Angell) continued thus.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:54530:111"/>
                  <p>The ſecond diſcontent which troubleth me, ſaid <hi>Lucian,</hi> is that thou couldeſt not ſteale away <hi>Leonor</hi> the Neece of <hi>Don Ignigo,</hi> whom I thought to have kept in ſome ſecret place as a ſtranger and a very fair Maide. I thought to have come to the end of my deſign in deſpite of her and her reſiſtance. See Sir, what inſolent words: If we ſhould have ſtolne her away, anſwered <hi>Fabrice,</hi> I believe that you would not have received thereby much pleaſure; for I do not know how one can finde it, where there is no correſpondence in deſires, nor that one can exerciſe ſuch rigour upon a beauty, who is ſeen with tears in her eyes to lament the loſſe of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Pitty, then anſwered <hi>Lucian,</hi> hath hindered thee from ſatisfying my will. <hi>Fabrice</hi> made excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which <hi>Lucian</hi> received for that time; yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to himſelfe to ſearch occaſion to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his raſh deſigne, as far as to take the boldneſſe to entreat an unſeaſonable houre into the houſe where <hi>Leonor</hi> ſhould be, although he ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſcale the window of her chamber, or force the door. <hi>Fabrice</hi> anſwered him nothing, it may be not approving what his Maiſter ſaid, as being too raſh and dangerous to execute: From whence it happened that two daies after, this unfortunate confident was found dead, with three ſtabs of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard in the breaſt, which I preſume was given him by the hand of <hi>Lucian,</hi> through rage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, as well for the cowardlineſſe wherewith he accuſed him, as ſeeing him not diſpoſed to aſſiſt him in the laſt propoſition which he had made. Since your growing well I have obſerved his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, as being troubled therewith, and lately
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54530:111"/>knowing that you begun to riſe and walk in your chamber, he ſtamped upon the ground, and lifted his eyes to Heaven, as if he had made ſome ſecreet threats. But yeſterday he came to me, and made me this diſcourſe. <hi>Glicere,</hi> ſayd he, thou art not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the damage I received in the recovery of <hi>Don Iame,</hi> ſince that the effect of my deſires is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtayed, and extreamly delayed; his preſence hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me from ſatisfying the paſſion I have for <hi>Olin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> in enjoying her beauty, I doe not ſay her love, though I have alwaies perceived that ſhe hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me as a brother, but at the preſent I am as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to her as an enemy, which maketh me at this time to be pricked on as much with vengeance as love, and that I ſeek to content my deſires to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the one and the other paſſion. For this cauſe I have recourſe to thee, having already communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto thee my ſecrets, that thou mayſt ſerve me in a new project which I have made, wherein I have need of a moſt particular confident, which I deſire thou ſhould eſt be, aſſuring thee that thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ſhall exceed much what thou ſhalt'ſt think to have merited. See here a certain powder, ſaid he, in drawing a paper out of his pocket, which you muſt make <hi>Don Iame</hi> to ſwallow amongſt his meat, or in ſome broath, the which wil cauſe a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous effect. He will fall into a languiſhing, and fall away from day to day, ſo that in a moneth I ſhal be rid of him. Doe not fear that any one ſhall be troubled therefore, the cauſe of his death will be attributed to his wound, upon the opinion that the Chyrurgeons cloſed it up too ſoon. Conſider how much this ſecreet imports me; for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54530:112"/>to thee, if thou deferreſt the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that I doe not ſee the effect of the powder which I put into thy hands in the time that it ought to operate, thy life ſhall ſuffer for it, and thou ſhalt pay for the fault of having diſobeyed my will. The impatience I had to get out of the hands of this divell incarnate, obliged me to take the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he preſented to me, and to aſſure him of my fidelity, praiſing God, that he had declared unto me theſe abhominable intentions. Behold this diabolicall powder, and I diſcover nakedly unto you, the damnable enterpriſes of this wicked man, aſſuring my ſelf that your wit and prudence, will ſo ingeniouſly carry the buſineſſe, that neither you nor my ſelf run any danger. You ought to be the protector of my life, ſince that I ſhew my ſelfe infidell to this Traytor, for the conſervation of yours.</p>
                  <p>At the end of this diſcourſe I remained ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo moved againſt this monſter of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if I had been in caſe to have riſen out of my bed, I had then attempted to doe it, to go find this curſed man, and ſatisfie my ſelf by his blood. But having paſſed this firſt motion of choler, I ſaid to <hi>Glicere,</hi> that ſince that the effect of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous powder was ſo ſlow, that ſhe muſt make him believe that I had taken it, and for my part I would ſeem to be indiſpoſed, complaining to feele my ſelf fall away every day, and that in the interim I would ſearch means and occaſion to catch this piper in the ſnares which he had layd for me. <hi>Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> retired upon this aſſurance, and I had a deſire to give this empoyſoner the ſame venome which
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54530:112"/>had prepared for me; but becauſe the effect thereof was ſo ſlow, I feared that he ſhould perceive the double intelligence of <hi>Glicere,</hi> and ſo his rage might cauſe him to ſerve her as he had done <hi>Fabrice,</hi> for not having executed his will; and again, that in taking the preſervative againſt the powder, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the compoſition thereof, he might eſcape my hands, and finde ſome other more ready invention to make me periſh under his. I determined then to ſeek ſome other way to revenge my ſelf, imagining with my ſelfe, that ſince that the term was thirty daies, I ſhould finde one, wherein no one but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould bee in danger. During this long time which I had been deprived of the ſight of <hi>Leonor,</hi> my health and love encreaſed every moment. She who acknowledged her ſelfe my obliged, for the great ſervice I had done her, wiſhed alſo to know me, and to teſtifie her thankfulneſſe, ſhe would willingly have ſent mee ſome meſſage, but ſhe was fearfull to be eſteemed light, not knowing what judgement I might make of this liberty. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having contended with theſe irreſolutions, ſhe layd all her fears on one ſide, and her love on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the laſt carried her beyond all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. She made me a complement by a maide that ſerved her, excuſing her ſelfe for having been ſo negligent in ſending to enquire of my health. <hi>Lucian</hi> ſaw her enter into my chamber, and envious of the honour which I received, remembered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his firſt deſign to raviſh <hi>Leonor</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Don Ignigo,</hi> which made him obſerve the behaviour and words of the Maide; ſhe afterwards told me, that her Miſtreſſe was extreamly troubled in her
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54530:113"/>very ſoule for the evill that was befalne me upon her occaſion, and that ſhe would eſteeme her ſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely happy to know the perſon to whom ſhe was ingaged for ſo great a benefit, as that was to have ſaved her from the fire, and from thoſe that would have raviſhed her perſon; in fine that when I ſhould be permitted to goe abroad, if I would take the paines to viſit her, I ſhould be very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                  <p>Theſe pleaſant words raviſhed my ſoule by mine eares, mine eyes teſtified what joy I received there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and my tongue anſwered with courteous words, that the firſt time I ſhould goe abroade I would not faile to come kiſſe her hands and receive her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Two dayes after I executed this promiſe, went to ſalute this raviſhing beauty, which heaven hath let me ſee againe, this day, either to verify my narration, or to give me an incomparable joy, after three yeares abſence. I ſaw her then at her lodging, I diſcourſed with her, where I found the excellency of her wit, and gave up my ſoule to her which ſhe ſhall poſſeſſe as long as it ſhall be lawfull for me to diſpoſe thereof. In acknowledging my ſubmiſſions, ſhe was content that I ſhould call her my miſtreſſe, keeping alwaies the ſame reſpect towards her which I have done in your preſence. Yet in time the acceſſe which I had to her grew ſo familiar, that one time I was ſo charmed with her converſation, and ſtayed ſo late with her, that the night ſurpriſed us before we thought therof, for being together houres ſeemed but moments unto us, her Uncle at that time came out of the towne, he had a cuſtome to ſhut the doore of his houſe in entring; and to keep the keyes
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54530:113"/>untill the next morning, he did the ſame then, ſo that it was impoſſible for me to get out to the great diſpleaſure of <hi>Leonor,</hi> fearing that I might be ſo raſh as to attempt upon her honour, though ſhe might have beene well aſſured of the reverence I bore her, yet ſeeing her ſelfe forced by neceſſity, ſhe was conſtrained to ſuffer me to ſtay in her chamber untill the time was come I might deſcend by a cord from a Balcony window which was over the ſtreete; the time came of my departing from her lodging by this way. <hi>Leonor</hi> looked out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to ſee if there no body appeared that might diſcover me; ſhe perceived two men to ſtand ſtill in a corner, and told me that I might ſtay yet a little. She was in perpetuall diſquietneſſe to get me out, doing nothing but goe and come from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to the place where I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and putting her head a new into the ſtreet, ſhe ſaw a third man with the two others, one of them having a lanterne, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached together, the houſe of <hi>Don Ignigo,</hi> &amp; ſtayed at the ſellar window, then one of the three begun with a croe of iron, to force and breake the barres of iron wherewith it was ſhut whileſt the other two kept the watch, looking all about if any one ſaw them, or if there paſſed any body that might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their enterpriſe. <hi>Leonor</hi> came preſently to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe me thereof, I came ſoftly to the window, and ſaw that the grate was broken, &amp; that they put down a ladder into the window, <hi>Leonor</hi> was upon the point of wakening all the houſehold ſervants, but ſhe was fearefull I ſhould be diſcovered, if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the lodging ſhould be ſearched, and alſo that finding her in her clothes at this houre, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

His two companions which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, ſeeing that there was a man fallen from that window, came to ſee who it was; and as they returned in the obſcurity, they touched the tricker of a piſtoll which <hi>Lucian</hi> had hanging at his girdle, and which was ſo well directed, that it blew two bullets into the head of one of his confederates, which fell downe dead by him, ſo paying for the charity which he had in being his Scout. The other ſeeing his companion ſo ill treated, believed that he which had leaped from the window, had uſed this ſtratagem for to kill them both by foul play, ſo that fearing to have the like misfortune with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, he fled haſtily away.</p>
                  <p>Seeing things in this eſtate, and the perill which we ran both of us; <hi>Leonor,</hi> if it ſhould be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the murder was done in her houſe, and I being known for the homicide, I reſolved to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant my ſelf from all inconveniences, by abſenting my ſelf from <hi>Leride,</hi> and taking <hi>Leonor</hi> with me,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54530:115"/>for after the firſt fault a hundred others are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For this effect I went down from her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into the cellar, by which <hi>Lucian</hi> was got in; I went up the ladder into the ſtreet, drew it from the window, and faſtned it to a cord which <hi>Leonor</hi> threw me from her window; then ſhe faſtned it to the croſſe bar of the window, which being done, ſhe couragiouſly deſcended, but we had not taken heed enough of the length, and faſtning of the ladder, it wanted ſix or ſeven ſteps of touching the earth, ſo that <hi>Leonor</hi> fell this diſtance, and if I had not half received her in mine arms, I believe that the tomb of her youth and life would have been at the foot of this ladder; yet for all my catching her ſhe hurt one of her feet againſt the pavement, ſo much that it was impoſſible for her to goe one ſtep. I leave you to think in what pain I was then; on the one ſide I had a ſpectacle of two dead men; on another a houſe broken; with theſe I found my ſelf enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to defend and aſſiſt a perſon which was ſo dear to me, and to whom I had ſo many obligations, and yet conſtrained to warrant my ſelfe from ſo many accuſations that threatned me. I aſſure my ſelf that the beſt wit would have been much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt ſo many diſgraces; for my part, I doe avow that I found my ſelf extreamly amazed, and knew not what to reſolve upon: one while I thought that the moſt convenient remedy for me was to leave <hi>Leride,</hi> but conſidering that I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of neceſſaries for a voyage, I changed my opinion. After a thouſand various thoughts, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to ſtir yet, untill I ſaw what brute would be publiſhed of this ſtrange ſucceſſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54530:115"/>we thought it expedient that <hi>Leonor</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into her chamber; the reſolution was eaſie; but the execution very difficile, becauſe of the hurt the had got in falling. I got the ladder again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the window, to the end ſhe might paſſe by the ſame way that <hi>Lucian</hi> had made for us: But the poor Lady was extreamly afflicted when ſhe ſaw that ſhe muſt goe down a place ſo foule and ſlimy; yet ſeeing that there was a neceſſity, ſhe took courage, I paſſed the firſt, and taking her upon my ſhoulders, went downe the ladder, and carried her into her chamber; I repreſented unto her, that ſhe ought not to apprehend any thing, although ſhe ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of the death of theſe two men; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, this action would be eſteemed moſt glorious, when the occaſion ſhould be knowne; nothing more lawfull then to defend life and honour againſt thoſe that would ſet upon them. Having thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved her, I took leave, and retired my ſelf by the ſame way I deſcended. Before I went from this houſe, I came to the two dead men; I took the piſtoll from the girdle of <hi>Lucian,</hi> and put it into his hand, and did the ſame with the poyniard to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to give cauſe of belief that they had killed one another; the invention ſucceeded happily enough, ſince that all that ſaw them were of that opinion. The Juſtices having imployed above fifteen dayes to inform themſelves of the fact, believed that the dead men had been their own proper murderers. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time, <hi>Don Ignigo, Leonors</hi> Uncke, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an apoplexy, which took him away in leſſe then twenty foure houres; and as one misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune never commeth without company, two dayes
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54530:116"/>after his death, a Burgois, one of my friends, came to advertiſe me, that a certain neighbour of <hi>Don Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigos</hi> was extreamly glad, as well of his deceaſe, as of the occaſion which he had to be revenged of his race, ſince he could be no more of his perſon, for an ancient injury which he ſaid he had received from him; and after this troubleſome beginning, he told him that <hi>Leonor</hi> had been the cauſe of the murdering of thoſe two men, that ſhe had made them to be ſlain by a Gentleman that courted her not long agone, and thereupon he named me, not knowing that the Burgois was my friend; that he had ſeen her deſcend from the window of her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and me in the ſtreet to receive her into mine armes: in brief, finiſhing all the other particulars of our actions, he continued ſaying that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to goe and declare it to the Juſtice, for in ſo doing he ſhould diſcharge his conſcience, be the cauſe of the chaſtiſement of the fault, and ſatisfie his vengeance, which was his principall paſſion. This Burgois, which knew the intereſt that I had in this proceeding, prudently ſhewed him, that he ought to take heed what he enterpriſed; that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would not be believed, and befides he was much to be ſuſpected, and reproachable, fince that every one knew the old hatred which he bore to the houſe of <hi>Don Ignigo</hi> deceaſed. So it was that he moderated the motion of this accuſator, to have leiſure to advertiſe me thereof, and give me time to remedy theſe threatnings; I thanked him for the good office which he had rendred me, and diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth to him, made him believe that this neighbour was miſtaken in me.

For my part, had it not been for her conſideration, I had already been out of the Town, and if that ſhe would reſolve to follow me, I would warrant her from all perill, retiring our ſelves into ſome place where we might live contentedly, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready provided things neceſſary.

Wee tooke the way towards <hi>Valence,</hi> and for the firſt we lodged in a little hamlet out of the way for feare of being knowne, faining to have loſt our way, two daies after we arrived in a very faire village by which I had paſſed before, diſtant from <hi>Valence</hi> about twenty miles, where we ſtayed ſome time, and were as well lodged and received as in our owne country, for with ſilver Barbarians are tamed, and friends are bought every where; after ſome time we grew weary with this country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; I then had deſigne to paſſe into <hi>Caſtille</hi> and communicated it unto <hi>Leonor:</hi> but ſhe diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me from it by the recitall of the originall of her abſence from <hi>Toledo,</hi> and by the hate of any thing that might put her in minde of her brother.

The occaſion which invited me to goe into <hi>Sicilie,</hi> was that J had an uncle there, brother to my mother, whoſe high merits had got him the government of a port there, with whom I hoped to finde ſecurity againe thoſe that ſought after me, augmentation of my fortunes, and repoſe, to paſſe happily my time with <hi>Leonor.</hi> But whoſoever grounds his felicity upon temporall things ſhall alwaies finde himſelf fruſtrate of his ends; we were no ſooner imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued upon the ſea, but we found our ſelves in the hand of pirates, Turkes, who in deſpite of our reſiſtance, rendered themſelves maſters of our ſhip, our liberties and lives.</p>

Otherwiſe if J had not pronounced this high name and had recourſe to his aide, it may be you had killed me, taking me for ſome Jew, Moore, or Turke; it is then from the vertue of this divine name, that J hold my life, liberty, and the glory to ſee againe before mine eyes, that deare <hi>Leonor,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies loving, and to whom before you, Gentlemen, J renew the vowes of my ſervice promiſing her to accompliſh when ſhe pleaſeth the faith of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which J have given her.</p>
                  <p>At this laſt word theſe contented lovers begun againe to continue their imbracements, and talke together of their adventures, to the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſt of the company, but the pleaſures of the one, and of the others, laſted not long.

He had order from <hi>Selin</hi> to imploy all poſſible induſtry, for to bring them back alive to <hi>Algier,</hi> as well for to chaſtiſe them, the more cruelly with long torments, as alſo to warrant <hi>Magdelene</hi> from the hurt that might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe arive her, which was the cauſe why <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zouf</hi> uſed all his endeavours to board them without uſing fire, but he found more reſiſtance then he imagined. <hi>Mahomet, Feniſe, Don Iame,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> did marvels, they foure alone defended a long time the entrance of their veſſell: <hi>Frederick</hi> and the other captives which were in the veſſell of <hi>Nazouf,</hi> when <hi>Feniſe</hi> made himſelfe maſter thereof, teſtifyed alſo much courage. The veſſels were faſtened together, &amp; the heat of the combat, made the combatants of the one and the other veſſell, paſſe it without thinking thereof, ſo that they were together pel mell, when they perceived another ſhip, who ſeeing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether came ſo near them, that all of them eaſily knew it. This was the ſhip of <hi>Rouſtan,</hi> which we have heretofore told you departed from <hi>Algier,</hi> when <hi>Feniſe</hi> took that <hi>Nazouf,</hi> and arreſted him priſoner; <hi>Rouſtan</hi> was therein in perſon, who being

Theſe laſt words had ſo much power over <hi>Rouſtan,</hi> that having conſidered the authority of thoſe who ſpoke them, to whoſe offices belonged this action which they did; he regarded no more the reaſons of <hi>Nazouf,</hi> on the contrary he boarded his veſſell, and cryed to him that he ſhould render himſelf, as the reſt alſo did which accompanyed him; ſo that theſe confuſed voices, amazed and troubled ſo much the ſpirit of poore <hi>Nazouf,</hi> that without any further reſiſtance, he was conſtrained to yeeld and give up his arms. Thereupon <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Feniſe</hi> leaped into his veſſell, ſaying that hee muſt paſſe into theirs, that they might be the better aſſured of his perſon. <hi>Nazouf</hi> would not, ſeeming to be halfe mad at the foule play which was played

Part of thoſe who accompanied <hi>Feniſe</hi> were very glad of the happy ſucceſſe of the ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, the reſt were in care how to finde means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from <hi>Rouſtan,</hi> which preſſed them all to return to <hi>Algier, Nazouf</hi> conſented willingly to the effects of this propoſition, but <hi>Mahomet</hi> which feared the execution thereof, found an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to tell him, that hee muſt before viſit a little Iſle where the Pirate <hi>Nazouf</hi> had hidden the booty which he would deceive the King of. Thereupon <hi>Charles</hi> his ſlave came to him, praying him to joyn his ſhip to that of <hi>Rouſtans,</hi> that hee might leape nimbly thereinto and ponyard him. This reſolution did not ſeeme impertinent to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> judging, that if <hi>Charles</hi> could bring it about, they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily render themſelves Maſters of the veſſell, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there was no other conductor. But as they were about to execute this conſpiration, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered a Galley of <hi>Malta,</hi> as ſoon as the Croſſe was perceived by theſe Barbarians, a cold fear gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into their veines, which made them tremble; for (foraſmuch as they are ſlaves to the devill) they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54530:120"/>tremble at the ſight of the Croſſe. <hi>Feniſe</hi> and <hi>Don Iame</hi> faigned to be moved therewith, and to be in fear of meeting them; but in their ſoules they were raviſhed with joy, ſeeing that this was the happy ſign of their good fortune. <hi>Mahomet</hi> made a ſhew of fighting with this Galley, reanimating the courage of <hi>Rouſtan,</hi> who conſidering the great booty they might make, being three veſſels againſt one, took againe his ſpirits which were ſtrayed, with the apprehenſion he had, and diſpoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to attach this Galley. Who would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed to ſee the force of covetouſneſſe upon the ſoules of theſe Barbarian Pirates, where the love of riches hath greater power, than the feare of loſing their lives? Behold them then ready to goe againſt this Galley, but with deſignes much different. They put before them the Ship wherein <hi>Nazouf</hi> was come, and the generous and brave Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> ſeeing that they were Turkiſh veſſels, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelves to give them a brave reception, although they knew their force to be far inferiour, as well becauſe of their three veſſels, as of the great number of Barbarians which exceeded theirs, but their courages and valour ſupplyed this inequality. As ſoon as they ſaw them approach within Cannon ſhot, the <hi>Maltans</hi> gave them a ſalute with two of their greateſt pieces, which incontinently ſunk their firſt veſſell. Then <hi>Feniſe</hi> tooke away their Turkiſh colours, where the Creſcents and Halfe-Moones were, and put in their places Chriſtian co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours (as the Turks do ſometimes to deceive the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians when they meet them upon their coaſts) and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54530:120"/>adding to this ſigne the <hi>Caſtalian</hi> tongue, wherein the implored the grace &amp; aſſiſtance of theſe knights, they made the effect of their artillery to ceaſe. So that when <hi>Rouſtan</hi> knew the fault which he had committed, in not believing <hi>Nazouf,</hi> it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to fly, or for to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Seeing himſelf in this extreamity, and to take away the glory from the Knights of triumphing in his taking, and to exempt himſelfe from the paine which he might receive in their hands, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the bottom of his veſſell to be pierced, and by little and little it made a hole into the ſea in the preſence of the <hi>Maltans,</hi> rather chuſing to loſe his goods and life, than to ſee himſelfe a ſlave to thoſe who had been at his mercy, if he would have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Nazouf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Knights were very ſorry for the loſſe of this Conqueſt, but this ſadneſſe was loſt in the joy which he received who commanded the Galley, when he knew <hi>Don Iame</hi> his Nephew. This was that Uncle that he thought to have found in <hi>Sicily,</hi> as it hath been already ſayd, who being newly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> went from <hi>Malta</hi> to <hi>Cartagene</hi> for an affaire of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Don Iame</hi> extreamly glad of this good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, after having embraced the knees of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, named thoſe to him in whoſe company he was. <hi>Feniſe</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> ſaluted him, and after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand actions of Grace, and as many teſtimonyes of a generous rejoycing, they all entred into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and went to <hi>Cartagene,</hi> as well becauſe it was

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54530:122"/>
                  <hi>Don Iame,</hi> as paſſionately in love with her as in the beginning of their affections. <hi>Mahomet</hi> on his ſide thought himſelfe moſt happy to ſee himſelfe in a country where he might eaſily performe the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had to become Chriſtian and alſo to ſatisfie his deſires in marrying <hi>Eufemie.</hi> She alſo thought her ſelf much bound unto him, for his honeſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings towards her whileſt ſhe was under his power. In briefe every one of them was perfectly glad to be ſo miraculouſly eſcaped from the tyranny of the Barbarians, even <hi>Charles</hi> the ſlave of <hi>Mahomet</hi> felt his part of this felicitie, ſeeing himſelfe honoured and eſteemed by all, as well for his generous actions as for the advantages which nature had put upon his countenance, which made him ſuſpected to be of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther birth, then what he had reported. They were all ſo ſtrongly bound together in affection that they ſound their ſeparation extreamely troubleſome. The generous <hi>Frederick,</hi> conſidering that his houſe was ſpacious enough to receive them, invited them thereunto to repoſe themſelves as long as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. All thoſe that could habited themſelves after the Spaniſh faſhion doing it before they came out of the veſſell, for feare of being overthrowne by the curioſitie of the vulgar. The liberalitie of the knights was ſhowne in this action in giving clothes to thoſe who had need thereof. Every one of them as they deſcended kiſſed the earth of their deare country, they imbraced one another, all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging themſelves to owe their liberty to the wit and courage of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> who with courteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements thanked <hi>Frederick</hi> for the favour which he offered them, but was of advice that ſince that it
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54530:122"/>was night that they might lodge together in an Inne, as ſtrangers, that they might accomodate themſelves the next day with all things neceſſary, to be civilly cloathed before they made themſelves knowne; beſides it was expedient to informe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecretly of their proper affaires after ſo long abſence. This propoſition was approved by all the company, who tooke their leaves of the Uncle of <hi>Don Jame,</hi> aſſuring the other knights, that they would ſend them the next day the cloathes which they had lent them; they left them their veſſell to diſpoſe of as they ſhould think good, and having taken out their coffers and boxes wherein were the Jewels and other things, the moſt precious which were brought by <hi>Magdelene, Leonor, Eufemie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> they went to that Inne which was neareſt the port. The next day every one accomodated himſelfe with what he had neede of, and the night being come, <hi>Frederick</hi> prayed <hi>Feniſe</hi> to doe him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to accompany him to his houſe, and under pretext of demanding newes of a Cavalier his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſee if they could know him. In entering into the ſtreete he perceived ſome people who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his houſe, he approached, and ſaw great light in the roomes which appeared through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and alſo many perſons which went in and out moved vvith joy. Then <hi>Frederick</hi> regarded <hi>Feniſe</hi> without ſpeaking a word, being extreamely aſtoniſhed from whence theſe teſtimonies of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſhould proceed, and deſiring to be cleared therein, he informed himſelfe by a man which came out of the houſe without a cloake, and who had the faſhion to be one of the domeſtiques. You
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54530:123"/>know very little anſwered he, if you bee ignorant, that the Widow of <hi>Seigneur Frederick</hi> is marryed again to day, ſince ſhe is a Lady of great renown. Saying ſo, he briskly paſſed by, leaving <hi>Don Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> in greater confuſion than before. Then turning himſelfe towards <hi>Feniſe;</hi> Deare Friend, ſaid he, what doe you think of this anſwer? Is it poſſible that he ſpeaketh truth? I doubt not of it, replyed <hi>Feniſe,</hi> nor you ought not to thinke it ſtrange; for after an abſence of fifteene years, which are paſſed ſince you were heard of, it is believed you are dead. I do not ſo much marvell at this accident, as I am troubled with the trouble we ſhall preſently bring to the Feaſt, when you ſhall make your ſelf known, which we muſt go about to do wiſely and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for feare of a great diſorder. You have more cauſe to praiſe <hi>Perſinde</hi> than to blame her, ſince that he might have done this action ſooner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple of conſcience, and having atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded untill this time, ſhe hath given you leaſure to come to oppoſe the laſt execution. <hi>Frederick</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving theſe judicious reaſons, although he had his ſpirit much confuſed; they entred into the hall where the aſſembly was, covering their faces, to ſee ſecretly the countenance of the future Bride, and to know him which pretended to enter into the place of <hi>Frederick,</hi> they put themſelves into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſtanding upon a bench, where certain people looked over the heads of others. The firſt perſons that <hi>Feniſe</hi> caſt his eyes upon, as being in the place moſt eminent, was <hi>Don Lovis</hi> his dear friend, he who was the unknown ſonne of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> brother of <hi>Eufemie</hi> the Cavalier, with whom
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54530:123"/>he had made friendſhip, after they had fought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether near <hi>Valence,</hi> as we have ſaid before in the firſt book. They were near the one to the other, and with a Cavalier which <hi>Feniſe</hi> could not ſee well enough to know, but whom he judged to be of great condition, as well by his rich habits, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he took place of the other two. <hi>Frederick</hi> nor <hi>Feniſe</hi> knew not which was the pretended Bridegroom, they demanded of one of thoſe that was mounted upon the bench near, who being as ignorant as they, ſhewed them <hi>Don Lovis,</hi> ſaying that it was he, and that he was a ſtranger. <hi>Feniſe</hi> was much aſtoniſhed at this prodigious encounter, yet ſcarcely believed what this man had told him, becauſe of the inequalitie of their ages; for he could not have more than twenty fix yeares, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might not onely have been his mother after the common manner of ſpeaking, but was indeed truly ſo.

In the end he found an invention to doe it without ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall. He turned towards <hi>Frederick,</hi> and told him, that for to make this enterpriſe proceed happily, he would adviſe him to return to the Inne, to fetch the three Ladies who were there, making them take their beſt attires, and put their Mants upon them, (that is a great vail which the women have in <hi>Spain,</hi> which they carry upon their heads, which covereth all their bodies unto their heels;) alſo to pray <hi>Don Jame,</hi> and <hi>Don Geronime</hi> to accompany them, and if they would, to bring <hi>Charles</hi> with them, being of their company, and in the interim he would have a care to hinder the ſolemnity of the Marriage, if they went about it whilſt he made this little voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. <hi>Frederick,</hi> who had no other will but that of <hi>Feniſe,</hi> whom he knew to be as much affectionated to his intereſts, as himſelfe, went incontinently to ſatisfie his deſire.</p>

                  <hi>Feniſe</hi> ſeeing himſelf alone, would do an action of gallantry, which is eſteemed in <hi>Spaine</hi> upon ſuch occaſions: he glided behind the ſpectators, and came to the Violins, prayed them to look to his cloak and ſword; then he put a piece of cypreſſe before his face, entred into the middle of the Hall, and inviting the future Bride to dance, who did not refuſe him, although he was unknown, cauſed a Galliard to be ſounded, where he made himſelfe admired in many things; for beſides his being well clothed, his proportion, diſpoſition, and action in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54530:124"/>this exerciſe, raviſhed the eyes and affections of all the Aſſembly, who died with deſire to know who he was; at the end of the dance he let fall induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly his cypreſſe, as if it had been againſt his will, and preſently <hi>Don Louis</hi> knew him. Never man had greater exceſſe of joy without loſing his life then this Cavalier then had; his ſpeech failed him, but his arms expreſſed his gladneſſe, he ran to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, and held him locked unto his neck, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Leonard,</hi> who alſo knew him, came to take part of his contentment, teſtifying that he was almoſt angry that he had not poſſeſſed this felicity the firſt. <hi>Don Feniſe</hi> knew not which of them to welcome the better, he looked upon them, and imbraced them both at the ſame time, making them the moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and amiable demonſtrations his heart could invent. After all theſe actions, he took them out of the middle of the Hall, and whilſt the other Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers and Dames of the Aſſembly were moved with this joy, and deviſing together, endeavouring to divine who it ſhould be; he ſpoke and teſtified to theſe two friends the aſtoniſhment which he had to finde them ſo happily at <hi>Cartagene,</hi> and at the hour of his arrivall, at Feaſts, and Nuptiall Solemnities, which he eſteemed (ſaid he) as prodigious as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for he yet believed that <hi>Don Louis</hi> was to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her who brought him into the World. To bring in the diſcourſe which he had to hold him, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Leonard</hi> to permit him to entertaine <hi>Don Louis</hi> in particular, and when he was retired, he made him this diſcourſe. I believe that you are not ignorant that you are in the houſe of your Father; this is it that hath given me an impatient deſire to know by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54530:125"/>what meanes you came to the knowledge thereof.

               <p>About two moneths after you was departed from <hi>Valence,</hi> being revenged of the treachery of <hi>Don Jouan,</hi> I went to <hi>Barcelone,</hi> with intention to learn newes of <hi>Hipolite,</hi> and ſee if there was means to remedy her ſickneſſe; two dayes after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall, I learned of our friend <hi>Octave,</hi> that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition amended every day. Theſe newes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated my hopes and affections. <hi>Octave</hi> being willing to ſhew me the teſtimonies of the paſſion which this Lady had for me, let me ſee the walls of the chamber where ſhe was, all ſcored with our Characters, and my name which ſhe had graven thereupon with her hand; from thence he carried me neer her bed, and as ſoon as ſhe perceived me, one might ſee joy called again into her countenance, where melancholy had reigned before, and from thence, with a few viſits her wits came againe into the beſt eſtate they had been ever ſeen in; ſo that as I had been the cauſe of their alienation, I was alſo the cauſe of her curing. After the deceaſe of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the adminiſtration of his goods was given to one of her Uncles, called <hi>Roderigue,</hi> which is the Cavalier which you ſee ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Roderigue,</hi> and demanded his Neece in marriage for the ſecond time; ſhe, who had then more liberty, then in the life time of her Father, underſtanding that he went about to have her whether ſhe would or no, anſwered ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſolutely, that no man ſhould ever attain ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto but my ſelf. This anſwer being reported to <hi>Vincence,</hi> wakened his indignation, and cauſed him to conſpire againſt my life. Having adviſe thereof, I had a deſigne to prevent him, but my friends coming to the knowledg of it, knew ſo well how to perſwade me, that following their counſels, I ſhould abſent my ſelf for ſome time, ſaying, that it was not for her honour, and ſince that I was aſſured of <hi>Hipoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> they would order the time for our Marriage, whereby I ſhould have much more glory over mine enemy, then if I had the contentment of my revenge, ſince that I muſt be forced to leave the Kingdome, and ſo loſe the hope of en joying my deſires. I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hipolites</hi> opinion, who approved the counſell that was given me, and following her conſentment, I retired my ſelf into a Village neer <hi>

               <p>More then fifteene dayes were imployed in theſe joyous magnificences, where the moſt remarkeable perſons of the province were, and the beſt wits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed themſelves to write upon the admirable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of theſe perſons, and of their affections. But as there is no pleaſure eternal in this world, this loving troope muſt be divided, ſome ſtayed at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagene,</hi> others went to <hi>Valence</hi> their country, and <hi>Don Jame</hi> tooke the way to <hi>Leride,</hi> whereof he was native. <hi>Feniſe</hi> was onely he of this company, who
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54530:128"/>made a more troubleſome experience, of the inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of worldly felicitie. After the ſports and playes whereof he had but a ſimple part, he muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe alone, the ſadneſſe and ſorrow of the death of his father, deceaſed long agone. <hi>Don Louis</hi> was much troubled to take a time to advertiſe him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſince that, beſides the loſſe which he had made in his perſon, he was yet in danger to loſe his eſtate, or at the leaſt to ſee much of it diminiſhed, becauſe his kindred believing him to be dead, were poſſeſſed thereof, and had diſtributed it amongſt them. <hi>Don Louis</hi> uſed much diſcretion to diſpoſe his ſpirit to receive ſweetely theſe bitter newes, but he had ſcarcely begun his premeditated diſcourſe, when <hi>Feniſe</hi> who was extreamely foreſeeing, well knew to what end it tended and to avoid prolixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of words, he prevented him with theſe; I ſee well ſaid he, that you would ſuger the edge of the cup, to make me ſwallow ſome bitter poiſon, but you know me too well to uſe me with this ceremony and hold me in ſuſpence for to declare to me what imports me. Then <hi>Don Louis</hi> diſcovered nakedly unto him, all he knew, and although that <hi>Feniſe</hi> had much experience and conſtancy, yet his eyes muſt teſtifie the feeling of his heart, the loſſe of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a griefe too ſenſible, he ought to have a breaſt of a rock, that will not be mollified therewith, or at the leaſt to have deſired his death. <hi>Don Louis</hi> comforted him in taking part of his ſorrow, after that he had ſuffered, the firſt motions of ſadneſſe, his friend preſſed him to remedy the diſorders of of his houſe. This ſollicitation afflicted him almoſt as much as the newes of the death of his father, he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54530:128"/>could ſcarcely reſolve to doe it, nor believe the counſells of <hi>Don Louis,</hi> becauſe he muſt neceſſarily abſent himſelfe from himſelfe in going from <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene.</hi> So that he deferred his departure from day to day, untill that his friend was conſtrained to tell him that he knew well from whence proceeded his delays; for <hi>Frederick</hi> his father had recounted to him the honeſt ſute which he made to his ſiſter, and how much they were all obliged to his wit and courage, he prayed him, not to loſe time in recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his eſtate, and to aſſure himſelfe to obtaine all he could deſire, not onely from him his ſiſter, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from their whole familie, who reputed it a great honour in the deſigne which he had to convert his amitie into kindred; that he knew well that <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delene</hi> made great eſteeme of his merits, beſides the obligation which ſhe had for her libertie, that ſhe would alwaies prefer him before all the men in the world, and that he ſhould never have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him of the vice of ingratitude; theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were confirmed to him, by the complements and civilities of <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Perſinde,</hi> and by the ſolemne oathes which <hi>Magdelene</hi> made him in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in conjuring him with teares in her eyes to return as ſoon as he could poſſible, &amp; that he ſhould finde her alwaies conſtant and alwaies loving; theſe actions were ſo charming that <hi>Feniſe</hi> wanted not much of breaking his deſigne of going to <hi>Toledo,</hi> but the ſatisfaction which he was willing to give his friends, forced him to execute it. The day before his departure <hi>Frederick</hi> let him ſee a country houſe of pleaſure which he had neere <hi>Cartagene,</hi> where treating him magnifically, he begun to qualifie him
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54530:129"/>with the name of ſonne in law, to the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole familie. He tooke leave of them in this place, with a thouſand imbracements and towards the evening <hi>Don Louis</hi> returned with him into the towne, at the entry of the port they ſaw <hi>Charles,</hi> the ſlave that <hi>Geronime</hi> had brought with him, walking with a Cavalier very well cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and followed by ſix Lacquies clothed in the ſame livery: the two future brothers in law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached them, and <hi>Feniſe</hi> knew that it was <hi>Don Antonio</hi> de <hi>Velazques</hi> a cavalier of the court, who had beene his familiar friend, he alſo having faced him and knowne him, they ran one to the other, and locked themſelves together for ſome time with ſtreight embracings. <hi>Charles</hi> admiring this great teſtimony of affection, and ſeeing they were parted, Brother, ſaid he to <hi>Antonio,</hi> if you have imbraced this illuſtrious Cavalier as your friend, I beſeech you begin againe, as my benefactor, and him of whom I hold my libertie: it is the perſon I have but now prayſed unto you, and to whom I ſhall be alwayes obliged for my life.

                     <hi>MAdrid</hi> our Country, a towne recommendable for a thouſand divers conſiderations; whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome by the good temperature of the aire; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant for the fair ſcituation, and illuſtrious for its admirable ſtructures and aedifices, was almoſt at the ſame time the cradle and tombe of a Cavalier, rich in the gifts of nature, and enough gratified with the goods of Fortune, his name was <hi>Don Fernand de Figueroa.</hi> Of twenty three years which he lived, he paſſed two in marriage with a Lady of leſſe age than himſelf, but equall in quality. He left his dear wife a widow as full of hopes, being ready to lie down, as charged with troubles for his loſſe, which was ſo ſenſible to her, and her ſorrow ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that ſhe was delivered ſome daies before her terme. <hi>Eugenie,</hi> ſo was this Lady called, brought into the world an enemy of liberty, in a daughter perfectly faire, and a lively portrait of her dead husband, in a ſonne accompliſhed with all that he could bring from his birth. They were preſently carried to nurſes, which were choſen in the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges near <hi>Madrid,</hi> and who took upon them to give
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54530:130"/>them neceſſary nouriſhment: poverty or profit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite often times perſons to ſell their proper blood. Theſe twins arrived at Faith by the port of ſacred Baptiſme; the ſonne was called after his Father, to the end he might inherit his name, as well as other things, and the ſiſter had to name <hi>Charitie,</hi> it may be by myſtery, or to expreſſe the graces wherewith ſhe was ſo liberally ſtored. The Nurſes pleaſed themſelves in taking care of them, and to exerciſe themſelves with emulation, as well to keep them neatly, as to nouriſh them; in a word, they che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed them more than their proper children. A family cannot be ſayd unhappy, it it ſuffer not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſaſters; for it ſeemeth that the firſt misfortune is the harbinger that comes to prepare a lodging for another, as may be well ſeen by this ſucceſſe, ſince that the infortunate youth of <hi>Fernand,</hi> and his loſſe ſerved as an Adamant to draw misfortune into his houſe. About two moneths after the birth of theſe little ones, one of the Nurſes had newes that her husband was in great extremity of ſickneſſe, and that they feared every houre that he ſhould dye. Conjugall amitie ſolicited her on one ſide to goe have a care of her husband, on the other fide her duty and fear to loſe the recompence ſhe hoped to have for her good ſervice, hindred her from quitting her place; and leaving this houſe liberal and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in riches. Toſſed with theſe two contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, her ruſtique judgement tooke a mean, or to ſay better, an unhappy end for her ſelf. One afternoone towards the evening, ſhe asked leave to go ſee one of her kindred, and as it is not uſuall to refuſe to ſuch kinde of perſons what they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54530:131"/>for fear of angring them, and altering the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their milk, ſhe eaſily obtained leave, ſhee went out, carrying in her armes the little childe, having before taken order to finde at the gate of the towne the commoditie of a cart that returned from the Market held that day at <hi>Madrid,</hi> from whence there was but two miles unto her village. She found her husband leſſe ſick in his bed then in his imagination; and to the end that it might not be perceived that ſhe went ſo farre, ſhe reſolved to returne preſently, and immediately executed it, not as ſhe came, but on foot, and alone, the better to hide her fault, carrying the childe aſleep in her armes; her judgement miſtooke the time of the day, the night ſurpriſed her in the way, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the corner of a hedge, two men came to her, to take from her the packet which ſhe carryed; for the obſcurity hindered them from diſtinguiſhing what it was: ſhe begunne to cry and call for help, and becauſe there were houſes near thereunto, theſe two men fearing to be taken, gave her tvvo ſtabs into the throat with a poyniard, and tooke from her that which ſhe held in her armes, leaving this unfortunate woman upon the ground, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dying. This little infant was no ſooner in their hands but he awaked, and begun to cry. They much aſtoniſhed to ſee their hopes of a booty fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, were not yet ſo barbarous as to hurt him, his tenderneſſe ſerved him as a Sanctuary, and his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for protection. They fled from this place, for fear of being taken for Murderers, carrying this infant unto another village out of the way, giving it to a poore woman, making her believe, to oblige
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54530:131"/>her to receive it, that it appertained to a Lady of great condition, whoſe deliverance was kept ſecret, and the neceſſity of the ſecret had conſtrained them to bring it to her in this eſtate, as for the reſt, that ſhe ſhould have care thereof, and that ſhe ſhould have given her whatſoever ſhe ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p>What is it which profit doth not in imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? this woman received it tenderly, hoping for the promiſed hire, made her affection increaſe, which was the more warmed by the loſſe of another little child, which was dead a little before, ſo that happily ſhe had wherewith to continue his firſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triture. The ignorance of his true name, and her deſire to deceive her memory, made her give him the name of her ſonne, and attempting to put him in his place, ſhe called him <hi>Antonie.</hi> At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhe was impatient to know his parents, but afterward ſhe deſired that no body would avow him, for feare he ſhould be taken out of her arms. In the interim his true mother ceaſed not to weep, having known the accident happened to her nurſe, ſhe eaſily perſwaded her ſelf, that he had ſerved for a fair trophy to the triumph of death, and that ſome beaſt had devoured him; it is common to the fearfull to believe all which their imaginations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe horrible.</p>
                  <p>Nature, which diſcovers the birth by the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, giving deſires to every one according to the quality of his bloud, had not leſſe fore-ſight for <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> then for other humanes, we will call this child ſo in the continuance of this diſcourſe, ſince that it is his true name. Although he was ruſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54530:132"/>brought up, he did not forbeare to doe actions which gave notice of the place from whence he was iſſued. From his infancy, his ordinary ſports was to aſſemble the little boyes of the Village, arm them with ſtaves in faſhion of ſwords and pikes, then putting himſelfe in the head of them, made them march againſt ſome place defended by others, which they ſet upon, and ſo naturally begun to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to military exerciſe. Having attained to twelve years of age, he left the Village, and went to the Court. The King had at that time created foure Regiments to ſend into <hi>Flaunders,</hi> whereof one of my Uncles, my Fathers Brother, had the firſt. This little boy preſented himſelf to him, demanding to ſerve him; my Uncle conſidered his little reſolute countenance, his proportion and boldneſſe; found him ſo pretty, that he brought him to my Fathers houſe, to the which he was much affected; from the beginning he made him be clothed otherwiſe then he had yet beene, and after this change of clothes, he immediately changed his manners and faſhion of life, ſo that within a little time, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo different from what he was when he came to our houſe, that he knew not himſelf, making all to admire the truth of this proverbe, <hi>Honours change manners.</hi> All the whole houſe much eſteemed him; he had ſweetneſſe in his face, and mildneſſe in his actions, which rendred him pleaſant to the eyes of all; we two loved one another paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the equality of yeares is a ſtrong mediatrix of love; we were of the ſame age and height; we went alwayes together to our exerciſes, whether of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or mind; we learned the latine tongue at the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54530:132"/>ſame time, (a ſcience very proper for Gentlemen, and Princes; which formes the memory, perfects diſcourſe, and teacheth them eloquence, which charmes the hearts of the moſt barbarous.) And his ſpirit was ſo diſpoſed to learning, that there was none could win the prize from him in the whole Academy; he left all behind him, which made him to be beloved of the Maſter, and envied of the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; he had done there wonders, if his inclination had not carryed him to another kinde of life. At that time my Uncle was ready to depart with his Regiment into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Fernand</hi> having news thereof, imployed all his little induſtry to oblige him to take him with him, ſo that mine Uncle, to content his generous deſire, condiſcended thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Two years after the departure of mine Uncle, my Father had a burning Feaver, which carried him to his grave, to render the tribute which all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals owe to nature. All our Line was much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereat, but it laſted not long, principally for my part, I ſeeing my ſelf inſtalled in my birth-right, and in the poſſeſſion of a great eſtate, if I ſhed tears at my Fathers death, they were rather of joy then ſadneſſe, or for that he had no ſooner left me his ſucceſſion: humane malice lets us now ſee many children of ſo ill diſpoſitions; and it is not long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone ſince I heard a young Lord ſay, being in an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſix ſteps from his Father, that when chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had once paſſed twenty years, their Fathers did but trouble them. After the yeare of exteriour mourning, I begun to appear rather by my cloathes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then my vertues; I was clothed with habits, and feathers in my hat, of all the rare colours which
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54530:133"/>could be found, a vanity wherewith youth is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily carryed away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charitie,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> was then of mine age, and faire as they paint an Angell; her diſcourſes were ſo much above the ableſt of her ſex, that adding the divine qualities of her wit, with the luſtre and attractions of her countenance, one knew not what judgment to make thereof, ſince that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them did figure her more then mortall. Thoſe that would have doubted of her nobleneſs and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, might draw witneſſes thereof from the majeſty of her carriage, and the recluſe life which ſhe lead. She was knowne to none but the ſervants of the houſe, and went abroad but very rarely, and in a Coach, and yet was ſhe wrapped in a mantle, ſo well, that but a ſhadow of her perſon could be ſeen. Her houſe was not far from mine, and one day of great devotion, for the reſpect of the feaſt, I found place to ſee her come out of her houſe on foot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying her mother: They went together, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by two Gentlewomen, to viſit the Churches, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54530:133"/>know not whether or noe ſhe found ſomthing in me that pleaſed her; but either by artifice or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſhe permitted by her mantle a beame of her eyes to ſhine upon my face which laſted no longer then a lightning, I never ſaw a more raviſhing beauty, and from that inſtant I remained ſo char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that for a long time I was inſenſible. At the end of this extaſie I continued to follow after the ſhadow of this Sun, and conducted her with mine eye unto the doore of her houſe, from thence I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home my ſpirit troubled with a thouſand confuſions, one while forming a deſigne to declare unto her the acquiſition which ſhe had made of my liberty, and another while imagining that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, was no great glory to her, my humility ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me fearefull. In theſe irreſolutions I could not hinder my ſelfe from making rounds and walkes about her houſe, endeavouring to ſee her ſometimes at the windowes, this iſſued very happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet after having paſſed much time therein, almoſt a whole moneth was employed before I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a little light of this ſtar. In the end, not for to trouble you with the recitall of the paines I tooke to get acquainted with her, I will tell you that I perſevered ſo conſtantly in this paſſion, and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her ſuch certaine teſtimonies thereof, that after having ſeene my flames painted by my writing, ſhe had pitty thereof, or to ſay better ſhe felt the heat thereof. There are not many women, how cruell ſo ever they be, that having hearkened to the plaints of a lover, doe not compaſſionate his griefe, and aſſay to give him eaſe. A love which drawes nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from two breaſts of an infant preſently
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54530:134"/>becometh a giant. At the end of two yeares ours ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſo ſo perfect a grandure, and <hi>Charitie</hi> knew me ſo loyall, that ſhe promiſed me the laſt favour upon my word, I ingaged to her my faith in calling to witneſſe the celeſtiall powers to marry her when ſhe pleaſed, and with this aſſurance ſhe conſented to accompliſhment of my deſires the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; moments ſeemed ages in expecting the houre ſhe had given me, the day ſeemed to be eternall, or that a new <hi>Joſhua</hi> had ſtayed the Sun, but in the end light gave place to darkeneſſe; and then, as a generous courage called to fight, endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She who kept <hi>Seminell</hi> ſeeing me come ſo ſoone called me ſoftly, and prayed me to retire untill her mother was in bed, for feare that in expecting too long time, I might be perceived by ſome curious perſon who might trouble our deſigne.

It may be you deſire to know wherfore I have made this voyage to <hi>Cartagene</hi> from whence I come as well as you: the ſubject thereof is prodigious, I will tell it you by the way, and aſſure my ſelfe that you heard the like never ſpoken of, for it is rare. We will put you in minde of it ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> when my brother hath finiſhed the hiſtory which he hath begun, then <hi>Antonio</hi> ſeeing that they all concurred in the ſame deſire, begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine his diſcourſe in this manner. Since that <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur Marcel</hi> hath ſo often heard it recounted, it is not neceſſary to ſay againe what I have already told you, I will begin againe onely where I left.</p>
                  <p>As I entered then into this hall, <hi>Don Fernand</hi> heard me, better than he ſaw me, he retired aſide, for feare of being met, and put himſelf in a corner near the door of the ſtairs which went to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Charitie.</hi> I who thought to goe in ſecurity, and who knew well the lodging, went right to the ſtaires, <hi>Fernand</hi> who perceived me to approach, drew a Ponyard which he wore at his girdle, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was ſome of the houſhold ſervants, or ſome neighbour that had ſeen him enter, who counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ignorant would ſurpriſe him, and chaſtiſe him for his raſhneſſe, ſo that as I came to paſſe by him, he fell upon me, and gave me two ſtabs with the poyniard, the one upon the other, which (if I had
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54530:136"/>not had on a Buffe-coat which hindered the iron from entring farre) had killed me upon the inſtant, I fell nevertheleſſe at his feet, all bloudy, and in a ſwound, and at the ſame inſtant he got the doore and fled. In the interim <hi>Charitie</hi> attended, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much delay, ſhe believed that I could not finde the ſtaires of her chamber. In this opinion, ſhe took a little Wax candle, and came down ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where I was; at the firſt ſhe ſaw me along upon the ground, but not knowing what this ſhould ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, ſhe came nearer, and found the dear object of her paſſions almoſt in the like condition, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore <hi>Venus</hi> her lover hurt by a wild Boare. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repreſent unto you what griefe ſurpriſed at that time poor <hi>Charitie,</hi> it is eaſier for you to imagine it, than me to expreſſe it. She preſently judged, that her mother having diſcovered our ſecreet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, had begunne her vengeance upon me, which ſhe would finiſh upon her. This falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion made ſo ſtrong an impreſſion upon her ſpirits, and feare poſſeſſed her ſo powerfully, that ſhe thought ſhe ſaw nothing about her but the images of death. In fine ſhe ſuffered her ſelfe to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubled with theſe panique feares, that it was impoſſible for her to take any good reſolution. Without regarding her condition, without reſpect of her honour, or conſideration of the danger whereunto ſhe expoſed her ſelfe, ſhe at that inſtant left the houſe, accompanied onely with misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and adorned with the jewels which ſhe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily wore, which were, a croſs of Diamonds, which ſhe wore upon her breaſt, two Pearles like Peares, which hung in her eares, and a Garland of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54530:137"/>gold, Emerauds and Rubies, which ſhe had about her haire. Thus deſolate ſhe croſſed the whole Town of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and went to the laſt houſes which are towards the Meadowes of St. <hi>Ieronime,</hi> where the walkes and projects of Lovers and Courtezans are made. Having put up her ſtones into her pocket, ſhe entered without choice or conſideration into the houſe of a poor woman, not being able to go further, becauſe the day, which begun to break, might have diſcovered her.</p>
                  <p>All this while I remained in the eſtate and place where <hi>Charitie</hi> had found me, untill the riſing of a ſervant, who coming to make clean the hall, as ſhe did every day, perceived at the entry thereof a body which ſhe believed to be dead; affrighted with this ſpectacle, ſhe went to the chamber of her Miſtreſſe, the mother of <hi>Charitie,</hi> telling her more with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment then words what ſhe had ſeen. This La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy allarmed with this accident, roſe, and made all her ſervants to be called, who ranne all to me at the ſame time; they tooke me from the ground, and layed me upon a bed, and in the doubt wherein they were, whether I was dead or alive, ſent preſently for a Chirurgeon, in expecting him, none of them knowing what to doe to me, they heated lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloathes towarme me, and caſt water in my face, to waken my ſpirits if I were ſwounded: in fine, amongſt all theſe accurable diligences, they were put out of the paine wherein they were, ſeeing me make a great ſigh, which teſtified unto them that I was yet living. Thereupon the Chirurgeon arrived, he looked upon my wounds, and putting the firſt plaiſter thereupon, ſtayed the little blood
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54530:137"/>that refted in my veines. When my ſtrength was a little come unto me, I prayed <hi>Eugenie,</hi> that I might be carryed into my lodging, conjuring her not to afflict her ſelfe, nor to be troubled for my diſgrace; for although I was ignorant of whom I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, I did not forbeare to aſſure her that all her domeſtiques were innocent. She enquired of me how this misfortune had arrived me in her houſe; but not knowing what to anſwer her, I faigned that my paine hindered me from ſpeaking, as in truth it was very ſenſible; the Chirurgeon acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated himſelfe to my neceſſity, told her that I ought not to ſpeak; by this means I avoyded my troubleſome examination, and was carryed home. This good Lady extreamly troubled with this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, went up to <hi>Charities</hi> chamber, doubting that ſhe knew ſomething of this misfortune, but the firſt diſpleaſure was followed with an affliction much more cruell; ſhe ſaw the doore open, and the chamber voyd of that ſhe thought to finde therein. They called <hi>Charitie,</hi> they ſought her thorough all the houſe, but they knew not what was become of her; and when they had told <hi>Eugenie</hi> that thoſe who went to fetch the Chirurgeon had found the ſtreet door open, this poor Lady fell into a fearfull deſpair, ſhe tore her haire, and rent her garments, and made clamours which touched with grief the moſt inſenſible. She ſtudied to find out conjectures of theſe prodigeous events, but amongſt all her thoughts, ſhe could finde nothing but feares and confuſions. Oh unhappy deſtinie, cried ſhe, with force of torment, art not thou content with the misfortunes which thou haſt made me already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54530:138"/>muſt yet my heart be tormented with ſo bitter a wound, is it neceſſary, that after the loſſe of the ſplendour of our houſe, and the ſweetneſſe of my life, in the perſon of my husband, which was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from me almoſt as ſoon as heaven had given him to me, and after the loſſe of a ſonne, which remained for my comfort and ſtay, that I muſt be defamed in honour and reputation by the Rape of a daughter, whoſe pretence and company were ſo dear to me? But what, for the laſt loſſe I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove no body but my ſelf! I am the cauſe of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous diſaſter, having too much adhered to her will, and uſing too much mildneſſe in reproving her fooliſh deſires, now I am expoſed to the oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bry of all women of my condition, abandoned to the laſt attempts of misfortune, and overwhelmed with extreame miſery. Suffer then my ſoule ſince thou haſt wanted prudence in the conduct of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;</hi> and you mine eyes blinde your ſelves with weeping, ſince that you have not ſeen the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which environ beauty; and ſince that you have not watched to guard a treaſure, coveted by ſo many ingenious ſpirits, and ſo ardent in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. See with what ſhe entertained her mouth, whilſt by her eyes her heart diſtilled into tears.</p>
                  <p>The Juſtice advertiſed of my diſgrace happened in the houſe of this widow, ſtayed not long to run thither, knowing that there was wherewith to pay them for their paines. Amongſt the rumours which theſe Officers (and the people they brought with them) made, <hi>Don Fernand</hi> found invention to mingle himſelfe with them, deſiring to know who he was which he had hurt, and the occaſion of this
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54530:138"/>ſucceſſe; but becauſe they had carried me to my lodging, he could not content his curioſitie. He ſaw his unknown mother all in tears, and dejected with the oppreſſion of ſo many different croſſes, his heart was ſo lively touched with compaſſion, that if he could have believed that it would have eaſed her, he would freely have confeſſed his crime; he felt ſomething in his ſoule which provoked him to take pittie of this poor Lady, the force of the blood whereof their hearts were formed, gave him the feeling. They put into priſon all the ſervants of the houſe, the which was given for a priſon to <hi>Eugenie,</hi> with ſome women of her chamber to ſerve her untill the authour of this ſcandall ſhould be diſcovered The Judge promiſed the widow to favour her all that he could, to diſcharge her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the abſence of her daughter teſtified enough her innocence. Theſe things being done, <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> came to my lodging to give me mine Uncles Letters, where he underſtood, in confirmation of what he had heard at <hi>Eugenies,</hi> that I was the hurt man, and ſo ſeeble by the loſſe of blood, that there was no great hopes of my life: his heart bled when he knew himſelfe to bee the authour of my misfortune. He went home, not being permitted to ſpeak to me, he a thouſand times curſed the day of his arrivall, and the raſhneſſe which he had to enterpriſe an action ſo extravagant. Beſides his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſorrow to ſee me reduced to this eſtate by his little conſideration, he might well be afflicted, for the delay of his affaires at the Court, becauſe the good ſucceſſe thereof depended partly upon the credit which I had with thoſe who could fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54530:139"/>his pretenſions. They would not ſpeake to me of his returne, untill they ſaw my hurts begin a little to amend, then he came to ſee me, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting me with the letters from mine Uncle, the feeling of the affection which I bore him, exceeded that of my hurt, although it was great, made me almoſt goe out of my bed to embrace him; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome time with our armes about one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necks, which when we quitted, I obſerved that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I read my letters, which in few words contayned many recommendations of the merits of <hi>Fernand,</hi> and I thereupon told him, that my duty and his vertue ſo ſtraightly obliged me to ſerve him, that theſe, letters were ſuperfluous; after theſe civill complements, the deſire which <hi>Fernand</hi> had to underſtand by what encounter I came into the houſe where this ſtrange accident had happened us, obliged him to put me upon the diſcourſe of the eſtate I found my ſelfe in: and I who had the like deſire to entertaine him with this ſubject, as being my ancient friend, I made him the recitalof all my adventure, from the beginning untill the very point where he ſaw me (amongſt friends there need no great praiers, for to recount the ſucceſſes cauſed by ladies) and when I came to ſpeake of his encounter, and of the time that he hurt me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I revenged my ſelfe too cruelly, of his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for in ſtead of two blowes with a poiniard which he gave me, I gave him more then a hundred, as many words as I ſpoke, were ſo many daggers points wherewith I pierced his heart, ſo ſenſible was the griefe he had thereof. I have uſed, ſaid I to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54530:139"/>him, all poſſible diligence to diſcover who hath ſo treated me, but neither in thought nor otherwiſe, can I finde any ſubject capable of this accuſation; ſo that I am conſtrained to imagine, that it is from my ſelfe that I have received this rigorous chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that it is come to me from ſome ſoveraigne power; I have ſome reaſon to believe, and call it ſo, and your ſelf will have the ſame opinion; ſee upon what I ground it.</p>
                  <p>When I tooke acceſſe to <hi>Charitie,</hi> I affected but her beauty, and pretended but only to delights; for at the ſame time I courted another Lady, and ſought her in marriage, becauſe of her great riches; in the one I loved pleaſure, and in the other profit, in this the faſhion, in that the waight, ſo that my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe exceeding my love, counſelled me that it was better, to have gold in money then in threads of haire, and to poſſeſſe pearles that reſembled teeth, then teeth that were like pearles. I propounded alſo to my ſelf, that in enjoying <hi>Charitie,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Cleonte,</hi> ſo was this other Lady called, all my deſires would be contented, and in this project I endeavoured to amuſe and abuſe with my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes this poore Lover which confided therein. So that under theſe perfideous aſſurances, I went cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly to raviſh her honour, with intention to glory in her ſhame, when heaven, the faithfull protector of innocents, and revenger of treaſon, made mee meet with a hand that puniſhed the will as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the crime: If I dyed not upon the place, I believe that it was but to give me leaſure to repent my fault.

                  <p>This curſed woman had a husband of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who was unknowne to <hi>Charitie,</hi> not having entred into his houſe ſince her coming hither: he had no other exerciſe, with foure companions which he had, but to watch paſſengers, into favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places, to take from them and lighten them of what they carried. <hi>Fregonde</hi> advertiſed him by a letter, of the voyage which ſhe was about to make, with a woman, without naming her, it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, who carryed jewells of great valew, with ſome pearles of ſuch, and ſuch faſhions, that he ſhould ſeparate himſelfe from his company, for ſome time, that the enterpriſe might be the more ſecretly executed, and that they might remaine the ſole maſters of the booty; beſides, that they two going alone without defence, there was no neede of other helpe; the letter being well ſealed ſhe directed it to a tavarne, where this thiefe and his complices frequented, every day, having intelligence with the maſter thereof: then ſhe put it into the hands of a Merchants man, which did nothing but goe and come upon the way where her husband was; having buſineſſe for his maſter, and neceſſarily paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by this tavern, becauſe it was upon the high way, <hi>Fregonde</hi> thought that her letter ſhould be faithfully delivered, becauſe ſhe halfe knew this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, having often ſeen him frequent the houſe, next to hers; and alſo having expreſſely recommended it to him: but this meſſenger who knew the evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Leon,</hi> the name of the husband of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde,</hi> and of the taverne whereunto this letter was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54530:141"/>directed, by divine inſpiration, as I believe curious to ſee the contents of this letter, which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not being too well aſſured that there was nothing therein to his disadvantage, whatſoever it was he opened it, and ſaw the complot which this wicked woman made with her husband. This man would willingly have returned to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to have accuſed her to the juſtices, but a diſpatch which he carried for his maſter could not permit him to returne. Yet he determined to prevent, and hinder this conſpiration, in declaring it to the Juſtice of the towne next to the tavern. In this reſolution he went on and continued his voyage, but by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune he loſt the letter by the way, before he arrived at <hi>Illeſcas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of the people of <hi>Eugenies</hi> coming from that towne upon ſome buſineſſe of miſtreſſes, ſeeing this letter, lighted, tooke it up, and read what you have heard, &amp; put it in his pocket; aſtoniſhed at the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, that is commited in this world. Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and having rendered account to his miſtreſſe of his voyage, he ſhewed her this letter, not knowing that ſhe had intereſt therein, and told not how he had found it in the high way, admiring divine providence, for having it may be, hindered the execution of this theft, by the loſſe of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this lady read it two or three times, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſtill clearer which ſhe ſuſpected, for although there was no name, the quality of the jewels which ſhe ſpecified, made her preſume that they were thoſe of <hi>Charitie,</hi> ſhe begun againe to renew her eyes and groanes; ſhe believed her daughter dead, and her honour violated, imagining that they could not
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54530:142"/>take away her life, without ſtripping her of her in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tegrity; after the moſt violent apprehenſions of theſe new ſorrowes, were a little moderated, ſhe forced her ſelfe to reſiſt againſt the exceſſe of her affliction, to the end to attempt it by the the meanes of this letter, ſhe could get notice of the rape of <hi>Charitie,</hi> for ſhe believed that ſhe was ſtolne away. She went to the Preſident and ſoveraigne magiſtrate of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> let him heare her plaints, and recitall of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, producing this letter, which might give ſome light in theſe confuſions. There was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary preſently deputed to goe ſearch the places about this tavern, and to ſeiſe upon the hoſt: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this ordinance was promptly made, it could not be ſo diligently executed, but two or three daies after the meſſenger arrived at the place where he had deſigne to reveale his ſecret to the Juſtice, but as he thought to have done it, he found not his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which might render teſtimony of his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. then judging that he ſhould not be believed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he went on. In following his way he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the ſame theeves, amongſt whom was the husband of <hi>Fregonde;</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus in danger to loſe his life, and money, he remembred himſelfe of the name of the perſon to whom the letter was directed. He demanded if <hi>Leon</hi> was not in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and they told him that he was their chiefe; at the inſtant he tooke him aſide and told him in this torment of feare, all that was contayned in the letter, the apprehenſion of death wherein he was made him tell all. <hi>Leon</hi> cunningly informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of all the circumſtances, that ſeemed impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant whereby he knew the riches of the propoſed
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54530:142"/>theft, and the terrour which oppreſſed this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man. He gave him his liberty for his adviſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging him by oathe to diſcover nothing of what he had told him to any one. See this unhappy meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger eſcaped from the hands of theſe thieves whileſt on the other ſide <hi>Leon</hi> disbanded himſelfe upon the inſtant, and went all alone to attend the prey which he hoped for. Whileſt this was done <hi>Charitie</hi> was upon her way, mounted upon a Mule, and followed by her treacherous companion on foote, going little journeyes, and advancing towards the rendez-vous of theſe unhappy people, where ſhe was to loſe in a moment all the gratifications which fortune had given her in many yeares; her perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous guide, meaſured ſo well, I would ſay ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, her time, that ſhe arrived towards night at <hi>Sierca Morena;</hi> poore <hi>Charitie</hi> travelled in feare, the heart, the faithfull nuntio of good or evill, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed her of the danger ſhe was going to fall into, the effect thereof was not much delayed, in paſſing by a cloſe way. <hi>Leon</hi> came out of a certaine place, full of buſhes and thornes: and as a ravenous wolfe ſurpriſeth an innocent ſheepe, this Lion ceazed with his clawes upon fearefull <hi>Charitie,</hi> who fell in a ſwound for feare upon the inſtant, the perfidious <hi>Fregonde</hi> begun to cry out and faining to run away, ſhe drew aſide into the buſhes, and then this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian inſenſible of the griefe of this young gentlewoman, without reſpect of her beauty, ſearched her all over: but he had ſcarcely begun this inſolent action, when he heard a horſeman to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, who being in this ſuſpicious place fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to theeves, gallopped with his piſtoll in his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54530:143"/>hand and the cock up, this theefe could not ſo ſoon retire himſelfe out of the way, but this Cavalier was with him, they were both of them in diſtruſt, the one believing they came to take him , and the other that they would rob him, becauſe that <hi>Leon</hi> was equipaged in ſuch manner, that he might be well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fora thiefe. He ſeeing the poſture of the Cavalier, preſented him with the mouth of his carabin which which he wore in a belt, but by good fortune it tooke not fire; the Cavalier loſt no time, but diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his piſtoll againſt his body charged with two bullets, before he could draw his ſword, as he was going to doe, <hi>Leon</hi> fell to the ground, not dead but dangerouſly wounded. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> lighted (this was the revenger of the crimes of this theefe) and ceazed upon his armes to ſerve himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, in caſe of neede. He ſeeing himſelfe ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſpatched, by the aſſiſtance of my credit, went towards <hi>Seville</hi> as well for the deſire he had to ſee ſo faire a towne, as to make a young gentleman which dwelt there, it being the place of his birth, the firſt captaine of his little regiment, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to make him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of his good fortune.</p>
                  <p>Juſt heaven, which maketh us ſometime to feele its rigours, to give us afterwards abundance of favours, permitted that <hi>Charitie</hi> came from her mortall trance, wherein ſhe was falne. In opening her eyes ſhe ſaw the traytereſſe <hi>Fregonde,</hi> with a viſage of a fury of hell groaping yet in her breaſt where ſhe had put her jewells, and then with feeble voice: What <hi>Fregonde</hi> ſaid ſhe, are theſe the effects of a perſon, who hath ſworne to me an amitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable? ah cruell! is it poſſible that thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54530:143"/>with the theeves which have robbed me? <hi>Don Fernand</hi> who ſeemed to be deſtinated for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Charitie,</hi> hearing this plantive voice, ran preſently to the place where ſhe was, he ſaw this maide along upon the ground, and this curſed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſtripping her of her jewells and clothes. <hi>Fergon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> had heard the piſtoll diſcharged, but ſhe thought it had beene her husband that had ſhot for ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; for ſhe had not ſeene the Cavalier: ſo that when he came neere her, ſhe believed that it was <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> who returned, ſo much ſhe was troubled, and attentive to her wicked action. The cavalier ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this young beauty thus rudely treated, moved with compaſſion, and blinded with choler, or it may be, put forwards by heaven, which ſerveth it ſelfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often of one man to puniſh another, gave her three blowes with his ſword, which made three iſſues for her ſoule to goe the ſooner out of her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous body. <hi>Charitie,</hi> who ſaw this action, imagined that ſhe had done <hi>Fregonde</hi> wrong to ſuſpecther of infidelitie, and believed that this Cavalier was the ſame theefe that had ſtayed them: ſo that ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>xpected the ſame misfortune that had befalne her compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as <hi>death flyeth ordinarily from thoſe that expect it,</hi> it happened ſo to her. Finiſh bloodſucker, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Fernand,</hi> finiſh to glut thy cruelty, and take from me this languiſhing life. He knowing that ſhe tooke him for the theefe, anſwered her, Madame you ſee the defendor of your perſon and life, and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that will expoſe his, for your ſervice if you pleaſe. <hi>Charitie</hi> hearing theſe words found her ſelfe more confounded then before, ſhe knew not what to thinke thereof, but conſidering that ſo courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54530:144"/>words could not proceede out of the mouth of a thiefe, ſhe called againe her ſpirits, and ſtretched out her armes to the Cavalier, who raiſed her from the earth. He conjured her to aſſure her ſelf upon his perſon, and to believe that ſhe was in the hands of a man of honour, where there ſhould be rendered her no diſpleaſure. Saying ſo, he approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with her to the place where he had left <hi>Leon,</hi> but he had drawne himſelfe into the buſhes, hoping that the Cavalier being gone on his way, his wife would come help him, and make him to be carried away and looked unto. <hi>Fernand</hi> not finding him, made no great diligence to ſearch him, hee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he was not ſo hurt as he had believed, and that he was gone to tell his diſaſter to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to oblige them to revenge him; in this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination he made haſt from thence, and tooke <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> with him, hee ſet her upon her mule, and mounted upon his horſe, and tooke the way by which he was come, returning towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the neareſt place of retreate was that way; otherwiſe they would have been benighted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54530:144"/>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in the end the ſhame of her fault with the promiſes of marriage which I had ſo ſolemnly made her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernand</hi> hearkened to all this diſcourſe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment and admiration, ſeeing himſelfe to be one of the principall perſonages in this tragicall Hiſtory. He remembered himſelfe that the next day I was to marry <hi>Cleonte,</hi> the Gentlewoman whereof I told you, and who was to be eſteemed, for having amongſt other good qualities, neare twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds for her portion, beſides the hope of inheriting, yet as much more, from her father. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidering then that it was in his power, to repaire the honour of this faire Gentlewoman, and to bring againe conſolation and joy to her mother, he found himſelfe engaged in conſcience and generoſitie, not to neglect it; being arrived at their Inne and having taken a little repaſt, he would let her ſee how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full his meeting with her might be to her, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring what he knew of my project to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Cleonte,</hi> for feare of ſurcharging her with new afflict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

He did not think to have made ſo juſt a compariſon, for this time I will breake my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Seville,</hi> whither I was going as well as you, when I met you, and for your ſake I will againe take the way to <hi>Madrid,</hi> hoping there to procure you that contentment which you deſire from <hi>Don Antonio.</hi> It is a Cavalier whom I know, and whom I hold ſo religious, that if hee hath ſworne to marry you, as I believe he hath, ſince you ſay ſo,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54530:145"/>he will never violate his faith, and it may bee hee would already have done it, if he had known where to have found you; it is therefore I would counſell you to return with me to <hi>Madrid.</hi> At theſe words <hi>Fernand</hi> ſaw that <hi>Charitie</hi> lifting her eyes up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, made an action which teſtified that ſhee had ſome repugnance to the effect of this propoſition, being aſhamed to goe alone with a man; and not daring to ſpeak her feeling, ſhe covered with the pretext of fear to be known. No, no, Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, fear nothing, confide in me, if your quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and beauty would not oblige me to reſpect, that which I beare to <hi>Antonio,</hi> whoſe wife I believe you will be, would make me uſe you with all ſort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.

                     <hi>Charitie</hi> was altogether charmed with theſe ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious conſolations; ſhe paſſed the reſt of the night in ſome repoſe of ſpirit, thanking God every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for having aſſiſted her with ſo magnanimous a courage, and diſpoſing her ſelfe to be conducted by the prudence of this brave Cavalier. At breake of day he went to knock at the door of her chamber, and told her, that it was time to depart, and that they muſt haſt to <hi>Madrid,</hi> if ſhee would ſee a good ſucceſſe of her affaires, ſhe was preſently ready, and they went gladly together. They arrived that day at dinner time in an Inne, where they found the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary deputed by the Preſident of <hi>Caſtille</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the theeves which upon theſe waies robbed

                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Baptiſte</hi> father of <hi>Cleonte,</hi> having appointed and choſen the day of our marriage, had invited all his friends for that time, amongſt the which <hi>Don Ariel</hi> the Uncle of <hi>Charitie</hi> was the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable after his kindred, this Uncle that lived at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and to whom ſhe went to ſue to his good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to receive her to him, being the onely poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of the eſtate of her houſe ſetled upon the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, as I have already told you. He left <hi>Seville</hi> to come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and take part of the contentment of his friends. The next day after the adventure encountered by <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> hee paſſed that way, near unto which <hi>Leon</hi> had drawn and hidden him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This miſerable wretch having been ſo long time abandoned from ſuccour, and almoſt loſt all his blood, and mortally hurt, decayed by little and little; ſeeing that <hi>Fregonde</hi> did not come, and that he heard paſſengers goe that way, he begunne to make pittifull cries, at the inſtant that <hi>Don Ariell</hi> paſſed by the place where he was. Then this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and courteous Cavalier made his traine to ſtay, and alighting the firſt, went where hee heard this lamentable voice; he ſaw upon the ground a ſtrong man, enclining to gray, of about fifty years of age, of a ſterne viſage, full of ſcarres, and ſoiled with blood, as all the reſt of his body was, who made him this broken diſcourſe, being oppreſſed with paine and weakneſſe. Sir, ſaid hee, through Chriſtian charitie have pittie of a miſerable ſinner, to whom juſt heaven this day maketh its vengeance felt; I have a recitall to make you, whereby I ſhall
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54530:146"/>diſcharge my conſcience (it God aſſiſt mee with life and breath to doe it) and give eaſe to a great family, which I have put in extreame griefe a long while agone, ſaying ſo, a great weakneſſe ſtayed his ſpeech; <hi>Don Ariell</hi> curious to know what this hurt man would ſay, ſent for water to a little rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, that ranne thereby; they caſt it into his face, and he opened his eyes; then ſetting him up hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely againſt a tree, two men of <hi>Don Ariels</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him up, he begun again his diſcourſe. Which way doe you go Sir, ſayd he? I go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Ariel.</hi> Alaſſe! Sir, replyed the hurt man, you may well oblige then perſons of condition that are of that towne, and in ſo doing render my ſoul leſſe criminall. Speak, my friend, ſayd <hi>Ariel,</hi> take courage, I will do it with all my heart. It is thirty years, continued the hurt man, that I have lived in the moſt infamous profeſſion that is poſſible for a man to chooſe. At the beginning I robbed in Townes and Villages, where I ſometimes eſcaped from the hands of Juſtice, and ſometimes alſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſevere chaſtiſement therefrom, but yet too gentle for my crimes In fine, after a perpetuall ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from <hi>Madrid,</hi> I was conſtrained to inhabit in the fields and woods, where I robbed the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and many times took away their lives with their goods; I roved alſo ſometimes about the town, and in the entrie of the night I robbed thoſe that came out thereof, or who arrived late there: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty years agone, one evening, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with one of my confederates, I found a country woman going towards the towne, who carryed a certaine packet, we would have taken it from her, ſhe made reſiſtance, and begunne to cry,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54530:146"/>and we killed her, this packet was a fair little boy, which heaven warranted from our cruelty, wee contented our ſelves to take from him ſome little ornaments, which gave me knowledge that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant was of high birth, we carried him to the next village, and left him in the hands of a poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in abuſing her with a ſpatious lye, to make her receive him. Some moneths after I went diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into <hi>Madrid,</hi> and ſecretly informed my ſelfe of the loſſe of this infant, they told me the name of his houſe, and that he was the heire of five and twenty hundred pounds a year, knowing that, I durſt not expoſe to ſale the little buſineſſe which I had taken from him, fearing to be diſcovered, ſince that time I have had remorſe of conſcience for the great evill and wrong I have done this childe, ſo that having intention to repair one day my crime, I would never part with theſe little jewels, what neceſsity ſoever I was in, alwaies reſerving them to ſerve as markes and teſtimonies to make the childe known; they were an <hi>Agnus-Dei</hi> enchaſed with gold enamelled, a tooth of Corrall, alſo garniſhed with gold, and a little chaine of the ſame mettall, which he had hung about his neck, all theſe are to be found, with the names of his father and mother, and his own, in an old cupbord in my houſe, where I have nevertheleſſe not much inhabited, which is near the Meadows of Saint <hi>Geronime</hi> of <hi>Madrid,</hi> it may be eaſily found in asking for my name, which is <hi>Leon,</hi> known well enough by my infamy, ſee here the Key of that buffet in my boſome: <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde</hi> my wife, in ſpeaking this laſt word his voice failed him, his eyes turned, and hee rendered his laſt ſigh.</p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:54530:147"/>
                  <p>The confuſion of <hi>Don Ariel</hi> is not to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo much the beginning and end of this diſcourſe had aſtoniſhed him.</p>
                  <p>After ſo ample a declaration, he had almoſt no need of this key to verifie that this childe (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Leon</hi> had ſpoken) was his nephew, and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne of his brother, loſt ſo many yeares agone yet for to have a greater clearing therein, he made it to be taken from his neck, where it hung under his ſhirt: this done he got upon horſe back, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his way, ignorant by what accident this old theefe had beene hurt, becauſe he had not time to demand it of him, which he thought to have done as ſoone as he had ended his relation. At the firſt he paſſed, he gave notice thereof to the officers of Juſtice, who neglected to goe thither, thinking there was nothing to pay them for their paines, as it is ordinary, and ſo it is believed, that <hi>Fregonde</hi> and he, were conſumed upon the place, or devoured by ſavage beaſts. <hi>Don Ariel</hi> travelled with the greateſt impatience that was poſſible, extreamely deſirous to diſcover the veritie of his doubt. In going he felt himſelfe troubled with two contrary feelings. On the one ſide covetouſneſſe counſelled him, to take the advantage which he had, ſeeing he onely underſtood this affaire, and to reveale nothing, for feare of being outed of the eſtate, which he had poſſeſſed ſo long time, and in danger to be brought to account, having enjoyed this eſtate, upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe which he had, that he was the lawfull ſucceſſor of his dead brother. On the other ſide religion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to reſtitution if he ſhould come to the knowledge of the true heire. After having long
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54530:147"/>time ballanced theſe two temptations, he generouſly reſolved, to yield to the duty of a good Chriſtian, and to the honour whereunto his nobleneſſe inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him. In this intention he entred into <hi>Madrid,</hi> the ſame day that <hi>Fernand</hi> and <hi>Charitie</hi> arrived there, for they were but one daies journey before him, and in approaching the towne they went very ſoftly, to let the day paſſe and arrive in the night, for feare that ſome one might know <hi>Charitie.

Doe not aske me other explication, becauſe the place where we arc is not proper, doe onely that which you owe to your word and the merit of her which I preſent to you. I was much ſurpriſed to ſee <hi>Don Fernand</hi> ſo ſoone returned, and more with his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which I judged to be a challenge diſguiſed, and in this conſideration, without thinking of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming my ſelfe, what ſhe was he ſpoke to me of, I told him ſoftly that I had ſome reply to make him upon that ſubject, and that he ſhould goe ſtay for me at a place which I named to him.

Vpon the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which you give me of your diſcretion, and the freedome whereunto your blood obligeth you, replyed ſhe; follow me, I am going into a houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an affaire of great importance: you muſt, if you pleaſe attend me at the ſtreet doore, reſolved to let no one enter, and doe not trouble your ſelfe with the noyſe you may heare there if any happen: but if any one offer to goe out, let him goe freely, without informing your ſelfe of him. As ſhe had finiſhed theſe inſtructions, we arrived at the doore of an houſe of eminency: ſhe entred thereinto, and I finding my ſelfe ingaged to aſſiſt her, put my ſelfe in ambuſh neere the doore to execute her ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I preſently heard the noiſe ſhe told me of, and almoſt at the ſame inſtant a man came out, having
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54530:153"/>a cloake, and a coloured hat, which came ſo farre upon his head; that the brims covered his face; for is was not ſo obſcure, but that I could well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this, hee came out as if hee were in choler, which I knew by theſe words which he ſpake, thus impudent women ought to be treated; there needs no other misfortune to our blood, but to have it mingled with that of an infamous woman; he was ſcarcely gone, when this Lady whom I had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed came out alſo, and coming to me all in teares, <hi>Seigneur Don Charles</hi> ſayd ſhe, I come from making the laſt proofe of my misfortunes; at the preſent I have need that you carry me to ſome friends houſe of yours, where I may put off the cloathes I weare, I preſently carried her to a houſe, in the Maſter whereof I had great confidence; ſhe went alone into a chamber, put off her womans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and came out in mans, ſhe praied me to give her my ſword, and to take another for my ſelf. I extreamly marvelled to ſee all theſe ſtrange actions, yet without enquiring after any thing, I humbly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed in all ſhe required, yet with great deſire to know what would become of theſe divers changes. We left the town, ſhe went the firſt, and I followed her ſtep by ſtep; ſhe went into a cloſe, a little out of the highway, in the middle whereof was a Dove-coate, ſhe made me hide my ſelf behind it, and ſhe kept a little diſtance from it, as if ſhe expected ſome one, wiſhing me to come to her at the firſt ſign that ſhe ſhould make me, ſaying that ſhe ſhould then have need of my perſon. I remained planted behind the Dove-coate, like a bugbeare of hemp-ſtalkes, my ſpirits much confuſed with all theſe myſteries,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54530:154"/>and without being able to penetrate into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of this woman, although I had time enough to meditate upon theſe actions, for I was neare an houre in keeping this ſentinell. In the end, I heard ſome one to come very deliberately, I watched, and perceived that it was the ſame man that I had ſeen come out of the houſe whither this woman had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me, and left me at the door, he approaching to her, at a little diſtance held her this language, <hi>Don Charles,</hi> ſaid he, before we come to the effect which hath brought us hither, I muſt tell you, that it was not neceſſary to make me come into the field about a thing that I would eaſily have done in the town. You ſtand upon two points in the writing which was given me this morning from you, the firſt, that I ſhould know that you love <hi>Violante;</hi> the ſecond, that you are reſolved to make me quit the pretenſions I have for her; I will ſatisfie you upon both: For the firſt head, I will tell you that I am troubled, that you have paſſion for ſo poore a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and for the ſecond, that it will not at all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to quit that which I never had, and which is as hatefull to me as death: You ought therefore to be content for this regard. But ſince that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know, that I never come into theſe places to return without doing the action for which we are come, we muſt meaſure our ſwords with proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on my part, that I doe not this action but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have called me thereunto, and that I would not doe it for the conſideration of <hi>Violante,</hi> nor for all the women in the world, not believing that there is amongſt them all one chaſte and wiſe, but ſhe that hath never been courted nor ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I did not believe ever to have met with any
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54530:154"/>thing that could have ſo aſtoniſhed me, nor put me in ſo much choler, as I was in, to heare this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as well becauſe it was addreſſed to me, as becauſe it was made in ſcorne of <hi>Violante,</hi> whom I paſſionately loved, to this being joyned the outrage wherewith he offended the whole ſex, ſaying that there was no woman that had vertue when ſhe was ſolicited to vice, I was much moved to goe correct this inſolent, but feared to violate the promiſes which I had made to her that brought me thither, yet conſidering that my honour was engaged to chaſtiſe the impudence of this man, I diſpoſed my ſelfe to break the inchantment which held me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Dove-coate, when this woman ſeeing her adverſary come towards her with his ſword in his hand, went to him, and being come almoſt within the reach of their ſwords, diſcharged a Piſtoll at his breaſt, and caſt him to the ground, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to offend her, or give her one onely word, I immediately ran in to ſee if there was any means to know him, but it was not light enough, then going towards this valiant woman; What is the matter, Madame, ſayd I, what have you done? It is nothing, anſwered ſhe: Doe you know this man? Not to my knowledge, ſaid I: It is, replyed ſhe, the Traytor <hi>Don Baltazar de Oroſco.</hi> I knew him, then ſaid I, he was a Cavalier which I have reaſon to complaine of for many evill offices which hee hath rendered me. Well, continued ſhe (whilſt her enemie rendered his laſt ſigh) ſince that you know who he is, you ſhall alſo know who I am, and the ſubject which hath obliged me to treate him thus.</p>
                  <p>I doe not thinke it ſtrange, that you have not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54530:155"/>known me, having never yet ſpoken to me, nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard the ſound of my voice untill this preſent. Know then that I am the ſame <hi>Violante,</hi> whoſe friend I told you I was, it is neare two years agone, that <hi>Don Baltazar,</hi> covering his treaſon under civill propoſitions, begunne to render me proofes of his affections, and to ſolicite me to be pleaſed with his ſuite, time and perſeverance obliged me to hearken to him, and to wiſh him well. In that time my mother rendered the tribute which every one ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to nature, leaving a great ſucceſſion in the town of <hi>Naples,</hi> of which place ſhe was native. My father deſiring to take order about that eſtate, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to make a voyage thither; at his departure he left me with one of my Aunts, to have care of me, and divert me from the trouble which I might have during his abſence. All theſe circumſtances gave me more libertie for love to lodge within my breaſt, and to <hi>Don Baltazar</hi> the more eaſily to find the way to my chamber. He deceived me with a promiſe of marriage, which he let mee read, where I ſaw that he took all the court of Heaven to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and abandoned himſelfe to a thouſand curſes if he failed to accompliſh it, the leaſt whereof was his prayers to God to make him dye by the hands of the perſon, whoſe life was the moſt dear to him. Not long after he tooke poſſeſſion of the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thing which was in my power, and a few dayes after he deſpiſed it; and as his deſign had been but to deceive me, ſince that he was ſatisfied, he made no more account of me, nor to viſit me as he had done before. Seeing my ſelfe treated ſo unworthily, I ſought all meanes poſſible to bring him to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his duty and promiſes, but the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54530:155"/>more I endeavoured by faire meanes to oblige him to doe me reaſon, the more I excited him to deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the more I experimented his ingratitude and my misfortune. In the interim his father trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a marriage for him, and he did not forbeare to conſent thereunto, without thinking that hee could not doe it, being already engaged to me. I ſent divers times to pray him to take the paines to come to ſee me, to know from his owne mouth, if the bruite which ranne of his marriage was true, but he alwaies mocked at the meſſage and the perſon which carried it; from day to day the terme of his marriage approached, and my deſpite augmented. I found meanes to ſpeak with him in a Church, and to put him in minde of his words, my beliefe, and his written promiſe; but the barbarian impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered me, that ſhe that had not merit enough to make a friend of, was not to bee received for a wife.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54530:156"/>he ought to have entreated for. After many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I thought that I ought not to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it to any one, for feare of hazarding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of others, betwixt mine errour and his crime; ſo that this morning I ſent him a writing in your name, wherein J ſayd you would expect him all alone here at this houre, either to ſee him with his ſword in his hand, or to oblige him to quit the pretenſions which he had for me. In uſing this ſtratagem, J imagined, either that he would ſee me this day to deſpite you, knowing that you loved me, or that he would not doubt but that you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to combate, knowing that you were his enemy. But having ſeen the day paſſe, without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from him, I cauſed him to be ſo well watched this evening, that it was reported to me, that he was in the houſe whither I lead you, wherein dwelleth one of his friends. Having received this advice, I furniſhed my ſelfe with what was neceſſary to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute my premeditated vengeance, or at the worſt to ſacrifice my life to the reparation of mine honour. But before I would come to this extremitie, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee this diſloyall yet once, to attempt to reduce him to reaſon and his duty: I therefore went out by the favour of the night for this effect, but conſidering that all men are diſpenced from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect when they meet a woman alone in the ſtreets, and in the darke, J ſtayed ſome ten ſteps from our houſe, expecting that there ſhould paſſe ſome one, whom J might judge my ſelfe able to entreat to ſerve me for ſcout. It ſeemeth that heaven, amongſt the infelicities which oppreſſed me, would gratifie me with the good fortune of your encounter, ſince
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54530:156"/>that there had already paſſed three men, of faſhion good enough, before you came, to whom I ſpoke not a word, but as if you had beene reſerved for to render me this pious office, my genius excited me to call you, when you came neere me.</p>
                  <p>The prayer that I made to you, when you ſtayed <hi>Sentinel</hi> at that doore, which was not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelfe with the noyſe which you might heare, was grounded upon the hope which I had to receive ſatisfaction in this place, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of this diſloyall, if he did not content me; but two men that were with him hindred mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, for I imagined, they might ſtay the blow which I would give him, or at the leaſt having exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it, they would put me into the hands of juſtice. Seeing then that I ought not to hazard my ſelfe ſo raſhly; I approached to this ingrate with the action of a ſuppliant, but in ſtead of receiving as he ought; onely in conſideration of my quality, and to attribute to an exceſſe of love, the reſolution which I had taken to come finde him in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he tooke occaſion therefrom, to treate me as a publique woman, adding to the infamy of my vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated honour, the ſhame of ſeeing my face maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, by his raſh hands. Is there in the whole world a woman of ſo little courage, that could ſupport ſo many injuries, without giving an exemplary chaſtiſement to all ingrates? Animated then with a furious and juſt anger, I reſolved to revenge my ſelfe, yet this wicked man is happy amongſt his misfortunes, that he hath received his death from a hand which he hath ſo often kiſſed and almoſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If I haue not employed you in this action <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur Don Charles,</hi> it was not that I believed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54530:157"/>but that you would have generouſly enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, but I repute your blood too noble, to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it with that of a traytor. Although I have taken away his life with a piſtoll, I doe not believe that I have uſed foule play, for without that there would have beene too great inequalitie betwixt my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and his ſtrength, my rock and his ſword, what ever it was, my victory ought not to have been doubtfull, otherwiſe I ſhould not have beene reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. In fine he is dead, and God hath permitted i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no doubt but you &amp; I ſhall be ſuſpected for his death; you becauſe every one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that you are his enemy and rivall; and I for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken vengeance of the perfidiouſneſſe which all the world knowes he hath done me; for my part I will enjoy the vaine glory of my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and avoid if I can the paine I may ſuffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed, before my juſtifications may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore I am reſolved to abſent my ſelfe. Jf you will goe with me, J ſhall teſtifie unto you the eſteem which J have of your perſon: and how ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble J am of the obligations which J have to you, I have already provided what is neceſſary for that purpoſe. There is an ancient ſervant of my fathers which attends me at his houſe, with jewells of great price, and ſome money, which J have given him to keepe, &amp; three good horſes. See if your heart wiſheth to doe it: time preſſeth and permits us to conſult no longer, things the leaſt premeditated, ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54530:157"/>her judicious reaſons, and above all ſuffering my ſelfe to be carried away with the love I bore her, which was newly increaſed by the defeate of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, which ſhe had taken away from m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to follow her, with promiſe never to abandon her. Vpon the inſtant we went to the mans houſe ſhe had ſpoken of, who was well advanced in yeares, but yet ſound, ſtrong of body, and of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. We tooke theſe three horſes, which <hi>Violante</hi> had prepared for to ſave her ſelfe with this man and a woman, not thinking of encountring me, and with the pearles, diamonds, and mony, we put our ſelues diligently into the rode of <hi>Toledo</hi> and arrived there the next morning. It was not judged expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us to ſtay there, any longer, but whileſt <hi>Oram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> (ſo was our guide called) could buy us poore country habits. With this equigage, we gained the mountaines neere to <hi>Toledo</hi> with deſigne to buy goods and flockes, and inhabit there, as we were in qualitie of country people, untill we had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for our affaires. The age of <hi>Orambel</hi> agreed very well with ours for our plot we had made, to ſay that he was our father, he had the care of all our affaires, and went ſometimes diſguiſed to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to learne what was ſaid of the things wherein we had intereſt; for which cauſe we were not willing to goe further from the court. I tooke the name of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeron,</hi> and <hi>Violante,</hi> the name of <hi>Lacinthe,</hi> the better to diſguiſe us. We lived there in great repoſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the time we two in perfectioning our loves after the manner of the ſhepheards deſcribed in <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na de Montemayor,</hi> whilſt that <hi>Orambel</hi> our adopted father governed houſehold affaires.</p>

I was enflamed every day more and more with her beauty, conſidering that mine honour could not be intereſſed in marrying of her, ſince that if <hi>Don Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazar</hi> had deceived her, ſhe was ſufficiently ſatisfied therefore; and beſides, that ſhe had never given him that liberty, if ſhe had not believed him to be her husband. J ſerved my ſelf of her propoſition, &amp; told her, that ſince that ſhe avowed me to take the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of husband, I did not deſire to be a lyar, and that if ſhe pleaſed ſhe might make it good. She that deſired it as much as J, gave mee her hand in the face of the Church, and J married her as the widow
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54530:158"/>of a Cavalier, diſabuſing thoſe of the village from the opinion which wee had given them, that wee were brother and ſiſter; and a moneth after J went to <hi>Naples,</hi> with witneſſes of my marriage, which were Letters from <hi>Violante</hi> and her Aunt, which made me receive a gracious welcome from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law. The fear which he had to die without regulating his affaires, obliged him to inſtall me in the inheritance of a great eſtate; and ſix weekes after he gave me leave to depart, counſelling mee to return to my wife, whom he recommended care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to me: I diſpoſed my ſelfe to obey his will, and the ſolicitations of my love; but in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne by ſea, the effects of my intentions were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by being taken captive &amp; carried into a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where God had done me the favour to let me know <hi>Feniſe,</hi> that I might remaine obliged unto him all my life, for as he hath delivered me from a conſtrained captivitie, ſo he hath engaged me for ever to be his voluntary ſlave. But if with this good fortune, and that to ſee my brother <hi>Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> in health, I could joyn the contentment of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe my dear <hi>Violante,</hi> I ſhould eſteem my ſelf at the height of a moſt perfect felicity.</p>
                  <p>This pleaſant narration left thoſe that heard it in good humour, and particularly <hi>Feniſe,</hi> knowing him who had ſaved his life in the mountaines; hee recounted the ſucceſſe thereof, ſaying that he was the Cavalier which was hurt, and that that which hindered <hi>Don Charles</hi> from then knowing him, was becauſe the firſt time he had ſeen him, he had his face all covered with blood. <hi>Don Charles</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely glad of this knowledge. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> his brother told him upon the inſtant that the death

                  <p>After that they had admired the marvellous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of theſe two hiſtories, every one kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſeeing that <hi>Feniſe</hi> prayed <hi>Marcell</hi> to entertain the reſt of their way, in telling them the cauſe of his voyage, when <hi>Marcell</hi> courteouſly agreeing to what they deſired of him, addreſſed the beginning of his diſcourſe to <hi>Don Charles,</hi> and ſaid thus.</p>

                  <p>I had a paternall Uncle in <hi>Cartagene,</hi> a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced for his vertues, and reſpected for his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and venerable aſpect; he married with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of noble extraction, but whoſe chaſtity was not too certaine, ſhe was called <hi>Conſtance; the effects of things doe not alwaies agree with their names.</hi> He had a ſonne by her totally oppoſed to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. The debauches of <hi>Don Garcia,</hi> ſo was this coſen of mine called, much tormented him; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in his infancy to repreſſe them by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, and in his youth by ſweet remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but ſeeing he could not prevaile, he reſolved to ſend him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he might there em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his valour (whereof he ſhewed ſome ſignes)
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54530:159"/>againſt the enemies of the faith, and for the ſervice of his King; for there are no occaſions ſo glorious as thoſe wherein one may render proofe of zeale and courage. He gave him Money, and Letters of favour to put his perſon in conſideration; but theſe Letters had no vertue, nor his Money was not ſpent in <hi>Flanders,</hi> but at <hi>Madrid</hi> the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by this meanes experiment of the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which there is betwixt an ill inclination and a generous one. Vitious perſons have no great trouble to meet with their like: <hi>Don Garcia</hi> found incontinently many friends of his humour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others he was very great with one <hi>Don Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazar</hi> the very ſame that <hi>Seigneur Charles</hi> hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and whom <hi>Violante</hi> made to feele the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of her name and vengeance, and yet very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In time mine Uncle knew the little ſatisfaction which my coſen gave to his deſire, and his proper birth and without ſpeaking any thing thereof to his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, for fear of troubling her, ſuffered his breaſt to be gnawed with extreame diſpleaſure. In fine, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring too often of his pernitious life, he fell ſick, and in a little time died. <hi>Conſtance</hi> was left Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with great i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>s, and alſo ſurcharged with much affliction, as well for the loſſe of her husband, as for the feare which ſhe had, ſeeing him dye for ſorrow, that hee had heard of the death of his ſonne in ſome encounter of warre; for ſhe believed him to bee in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that hee had hidden this accident from her to exempt her from ſorrow. I was at <hi>Toledo</hi> when they writ to me of the deceaſe of mine Uncle, and becauſe I knew that <hi>Don Garcia</hi> was at <hi>Madrid,</hi> J preſently went to let him know thereof; I found him hidden in the houſe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:54530:160"/>of one of his friends, becauſe he was ſought after diligently, being accuſed for the death of <hi>Don Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazar,</hi> he being the ſame night he was ſlaine at his houſe, and there it was where he had treated <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi> ſo unworthily, as <hi>Don Charles</hi> hath ſayd. In the doubt wherein I was, that he was culpable of this murder, although he ſwore to me that he was innocent, I counſelled him to goe into his country, to doe which he eaſily reſolved. He took the way to <hi>Cartagene,</hi> entertaining his ſpirit with the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that <hi>Don Baltazar</hi> had done the laſt time hee ſaw him at his houſe; and in remembring the words which he ſpoke that night, and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions (that there was no chaſte women but thoſe who had never been ſolicited) he would make proofe of this unjuſt opinion in the perſon of his Mother. Do but ſee this execrable project.</p>
                  <p>For this effect he paſſed by the town of <hi>Murcia,</hi> with intention to ſerve himſelf of a young advocate of that town, whom he had often ſeen at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in the company of Gallants, and men of paſtime, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom he paſſed for a good wit and a well ſpoken man. My Coſen found him out, and let him know, that he was returning to <hi>Cartagene</hi> the place of his birth, and before that he would make his arrivall known, he had a deſire to prove the chaſtitie of a Widow, a Kinſwoman of his, and of whom he had an ill ſuſpition; but becauſe this was an experience which he could not make alone, he ſtood in need of the intermiſſion of a friend, that he had addreſſed himſelfe to him, having knowne him moſt able, and judging him very diſcreet, to intreat him to aſſiſt him in this deſigne. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate who was of [a wanton humour, having
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54530:160"/>heard this propoſition, imagined that if this wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was fair, he would ſound her to the laſt proof, and in this thought he promiſed to <hi>Don Floriſell</hi> to ſerve him in whatſoever he would, and ſhould judg expedient. Before that I paſſe any further in this narration, you muſt know that my coſen had taken the name of <hi>Floriſell</hi> in arriving at <hi>Madrid,</hi> for feare of being known, and that his father might not know that he was there, &amp; not in <hi>Flanders</hi> whither he had ſent him. Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> diſguiſing of his name, and whereby I ſhall call him in this diſcourſe, did much favour my coſens abominable deſign, in that the Advocate could not know, that this was his proper mother whom he would affront; ſo that in this ignorance and gallant determination, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together from <hi>Murcia,</hi> and went to <hi>Cartagene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They lodged in an Inne neare enough the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where they changed their cloathes. <hi>Floriſell</hi> tooke the Advocates, ſaying hee was his man, and the Advocate his, paſſing for a Cavalier of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of the towne of <hi>Pamplone,</hi> called <hi>Don Felix Ozoria,</hi> who was come to <hi>Cartagene</hi> to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after news of one of his brothers, who was a ſlave at <hi>Maroc</hi> in <hi>Barbaria.</hi> The next day after their arrivall <hi>Floriſell</hi> carried <hi>Felix</hi> into a Church, where he ſhewed him the face of the Widow of whom he had ſpoken, who came every day to Maſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place; ſhe had forty yeares of age, but her beauty and features covered almoſt a third part of them, that if ſhe had ſayd ſhe had had but twenty five, one would not have thought her to have had more, regarding her complexion. Going from the Church, <hi>Floriſell</hi> ſhewed him the houſe where ſhe dwelt; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ter which the Advocate being cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54530:161"/>like a Cavalier, grew accquainted with a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaide of <hi>Conſtances,</hi> and by force of money, wherewith <hi>Don Floriſel</hi> furniſhed him, obliged her ſpeake well of him to her miſtriſſe. This maide ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo well in her perſwaſions, that ſhe obliged <hi>Conſtance</hi> to caſt her eyes upon him in the ſame church where he had already ſeene her. Finding him of handſome faſhion, ſhe permitted her ſervant to ſerve for enterpreter of the paſſions of this new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, and to preſent her with the letters which he gave her. Having ſhewn his wit by his writings which was capable to have moved feelings of love in the heart of thoſe who were never ſo little diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereunto, and who would give themſelves li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to reade them: he got acquainted with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> let her know his paſſion, and afterwards their familiaritie became ſo great, that ſhe promiſed to give him the laſt favour in one night which ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Floriſel</hi> exactly inſtructed of all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe aſſaults, ſeeing that the place was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be rendered, prayed <hi>Felix</hi> to ſtay there and to let him alone with the reſt. Then at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this generous exploit, <hi>Floriſel</hi> changed againe with <hi>Felix,</hi> he became againe advocate, and the other Cavalier he tooke againe his habits, and name of <hi>Garcia,</hi> and went to his mothers houſe, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in the place of <hi>Felix,</hi> who ſtayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde in the Inne. The maide was ready at the doore, who doubted not but this was he whom he expected; becauſe he wore the ſame cloathes and was of the ſame height of <hi>Felix.</hi> She led him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, or ſpeaking word, right to the bed of <hi>Conſtance:</hi> for although ſhe was miſtreſſe of her
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54530:161"/>houſe, yet ſhe was not ſo diſordered that ſhe ſhe durſt take a greater libertie for feare, the other domeſtiques ſhould perceive her ſenſuallity. This chambermaide helped him to uncloath himſelfe, then without ſpeaking word, he lay downe by his mother who received him with like ſilence. If he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the bed as mute, he remained there as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly growne lame: he paſſed the reſt of the night in ſeeming to ſleepe, and at the riſing of <hi>Aurora</hi> which approached to ſee this fearefull couple of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Don Garcia,</hi> aroſe and dreſſed himſelfe to bee gone without being knowne. <hi>Conſtance</hi> his mother ſeeing his actions, and that he had lien inſenſible by her all the night, imagined that he was inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or elſe that he had taken ſome diſtaſte with her; but rather believing the later, although ſhe was extreamely neat and proper, ſhe called him as he opened the doore of her chamber. Sir ſaid ſhe, very low, I cannot believe that you are he which hath uſed ſo many writings and amorous deviſes, to obtaine this cheriſhable permiſſion which I have given you, other wayes your effects are much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from your words: farewell, Sir farewell, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your continence as a vertue wich renders you incomparable. Yet ſaid ſhe in coming out of bed, and hindring him from opening the doore, before I gave you your leave, I would deſire to know the cauſe of your exceſſive retention, for provided that it doth not proceede from diſtaſte or contempt of my perſon, I am well ſatisfied. <hi>Garcia</hi> ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe conſtrained to ſpeake: Madame ſaid he, your ſuſpitions are moſt true, &amp; my effects different from thoſe which your ſenſuality promiſed it ſelfe, for I am much different from him you expected. Then
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54530:162"/>horror which I have had to pollute my fathers bed, and her blood who conceived me, hath obliged me to this reſpective retention. What Madame needes there ſo many words to make you know your ſonne <hi>Garcia;</hi> when unhappy <hi>Conſtance</hi> had heard this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and name; ſhame ceazed her ſo violently, that ſhe made but one cry. Ah, God! ſaid ſhe, in falling halfe dead upon her bed without being able to ſpeake or breath of long time. In the interim <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> having made her chambermaide to come in, left the houſe, and that very houre gave money and a horſe to this <hi>Advocate</hi> that had ſerved him as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſcandall, thanking him for the good office which he had rendered him, and made him returne to <hi>Murcia,</hi> without telling him the effect of his ſtratagem. <hi>Conſtance</hi> being returned from her trance, found her ſelfe in a burning feaver, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mingled with the griefe of her repentance preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to appeare before the ſoveraign Judge, ſo that from the time her ſonne had left her, untill the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of her death, ſhe had but leiſure to receive the the ſacrament (where ſhe ſeemed to be very ſenſible and to repent, her fault) and to make her teſtament; dying without any one knowing the cauſe of her end. <hi>Don Garcia</hi> conſidering that his impious curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, had killed her, durſt not appeare neither before her nor elſe where during her ſickneſſe: but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent after her deceaſe, he made himſelfe ſeene as arriving from <hi>Flanders,</hi> they opened the teſtament, where <hi>Garcia</hi> was found diſinherited; he without regarding the ordinance of his mother would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe himſelfe of the ſucceſſion, but he was hindred by two of the coſens of the defunct. He had with them both words and blowes, and in this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:54530:162"/>he outraged Gentlewomen his Kinſwomen with ſo many inſolencies, injuries, and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that it was decreed againſt him, that hee ſhould bee put into priſon, where hee ſtaied a long while, becauſe no body regarded him, all that hee undertooke iſſued very ill, and in the end ſeeing himſelf abandoned by all the world, and preſſed with extream neceſsity, beſides the incommodities of priſon, he had recourſe to me, and writ to me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring me to aſſiſt him in the miſery which he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, being abandoned of all his kindred and friends. This letter was given me, and many others, wherein he reiterated the ſame prayers, but I was not much moved to aſsiſt him, <hi>I</hi> was inſenſibly growne into a certaine negligence, which many times hindered me from undertaking this voyage. I imagine that heaven permitted it to be ſo, to chaſtiſe him for the evill he had done, in being the cauſe of the death of her, which was the cauſe of his life, after the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign author of all things. Seeing himſelfe redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſo great miſery, ſo far that he was not viſited in his chamber by any but the other priſoners, he had his heart touched with a very ſenſible repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; judging that all theſe miſeries were come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by divine punition: thoſe who brought him his meat, found him alwaies ſighing and weeping. Deſiring then to appeaſe the anger of God, and do pennance for his fault, he made a Vow with a good heart to employ a whole yeare in viſiting on foot all the holy Sanctuaries of <hi>Spaine,</hi> if it pleaſed God to deliver him from the miſeries wherein hee was. From that houre that he had thus acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelfe, all things came to him according to his wiſh, every one beganne to pitty him. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54530:163"/>at <hi>Cartagene</hi> with intent to endeavour to ſerve him, and before J ſaw any of my kindred, J went to viſit him in priſon, where after having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him with teares in his eyes, he recounted to me from point to point the prodigious extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie which he had done, which he believed was the originall of his misfortunes. I blamed, and chid him rudely for ſuffering himſelf to be carried away with ſuch a folly, and ſeeing the extreame ſorrow which he had for it, J became the vigilant ſolicitour of his affairs. By my intermiſſion, they (whom he had offended pardoned him) ſeeing that they had a ſufficient reparation) having kept him two years a priſoner for not penetrating into the judgements of God, they beleeved that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their meanes that <hi>Garcia</hi> had ſuffered this paine. Not being content with having gotten him out of priſon, J would ſee the clauſe of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his mother, and the cauſe of his diſ-inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; having examined it with counſell, we learned that the Law deprived from ſucceſſion thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who layed violent hands upon their Fathers or mothers, or who attempted upon their lives, and as the adverſaries of <hi>Garcia</hi> could not prove that he was guilty of any of theſe caſes (for although hee was the cauſe of the death of his mother, there was none but ſhe and he that knew it) the Judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proceſſe was begunne, ordained that the Teſtament ſhould be broken, and that <hi>Garcia</hi> ſhould be put into poſſeſſion of the inheritance, not onely of his mother, but alſo of his father; a few dayes after he was inſtalled in his goods, he enterpriſed to render his vowes, beginning with our Lady of <hi>Piler</hi> of <hi>Saragoce,</hi> one of the moſt holy places of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:54530:163"/>where the bleſſed Virgin appeared to the Apoſtle St. <hi>James.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We left <hi>Cartagene</hi> at the ſame time, hee to acquit himſelf of his vowes towards God, and I of my duty towards my wife. See <hi>Seignieur Feniſe</hi> the cauſe of my voyage which you deſired to know, and the weake curioſitie of my fooliſh Coſen, who will be wiſe hereafter. An example which ſheweth us the misfortunes which arrive to thoſe that will make ſuch fooliſh experiences.</p>
                  <p>The entertaine of theſe pleaſing divertiſements endured untill their laſt dayes journey. In approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to <hi>Toledo Don Antonio</hi> and his brother renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their thankfulneſſe to <hi>Feniſe,</hi> taking leave of him and <hi>Marcell,</hi> with a thouſand civill complements. <hi>Don Charles</hi> carried <hi>Don Antonio</hi> to the towne where <hi>Violante</hi> lived with <hi>Orambel;</hi> who had like to have dyed many times with ſorrow, not knowing what was become of her husband, ſince that hee went for <hi>Naples,</hi> his unexpected preſence carryed her from one extremitie to another, the exceſſive joy which ſhe received at his arrivall, had like to have made her tender her ſoul in embracing him. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> ſtaied ſix daies with them, and then he carried them to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid. Feniſe</hi> and <hi>Marcel</hi> arriving at <hi>Toledo</hi> were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with unſpeakable joy, the one of his mother, the other of his wife, the one to ſtay alwaies with his family, and the other onely to regulate his affaires, and take poſſeſſion of an eſtate which his father had left him, with the right of the eldeſt of his houſe. The reſpect which every one bore to his merit, made him happily proceed in his buſineſſe, vvhich being done, the Idea, features, vertues and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Magdelene,</hi> which kept the moſt eminent
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54530:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>place in his memory, obliged him incontinently to take againe the way to <hi>Cartagene.</hi> In few dayes he was with her to the great contentment of her father, mother and brother, who all expected him with great impatience to put him in poſſeſſion of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which he more paſſionately aſpired unto then the higheſt fortune in the world. It was his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with <hi>Magdelene</hi> which was celebrated before the miniſters, of the onely law, where he publiquely gave her his hand, as ſecretly he had done his heart, &amp; under reciprocall promiſes of a perfect union, they reaped, the fruites of their loues which had taken encreaſe and maturitie, amongſt ſo many different dangers, ſurmounted by their hardy reſolutions, and according to the ingenious conduct of our <hi>Heros.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having paſſed ſome monthes amongſt his wives friends, he would let her know his: for this effect by the conſentment of their father and mother, and her particular approbation, he carried her to <hi>Madrid</hi> there to eſtabliſh his houſe, and habitation; where now he paſſeth his life, with this marvell of beauty and wiſedome, &amp; with all delights which are to be taſted in this world. A ſucceſſe which may ſerve for a certaine proofe, that in caſe of marriage the union of ſoules is made in heaven, &amp; the alliance of bodies upon earth Jn the varietie of rare adventures deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this volume, the marvellous effects of love, and fortune, are ſeene, whereby one may know that the one ſurmounts all the greateſt hazards that can oppoſe him; and the other, although ſhe be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and many times maglignant, ſhe nevertheleſſe favoureth generous courages, and aydeth them to accompliſh their deſignes, when they are guided by honour, and vertue.</p>
